    "title": "Multiple Traders Revolt Against #Vitalik Buterin After More #ETH Dumps (OOC)",
    "content": "out of cycle update the Revolt is complete excellent cryptotalk FM my name is ler I'm your host not feeling well today I noticed I stumbled across social media and noticed that I appear to have caused or exacerbated a Revolt of sorts against the man I refer to as idiot Vick because they're attacking him like crazy a couple of months ago I did coverage on the dumps that the man was doing on your head and I told you to stop worshiping the guy as a God because he was dumping on your head and some of you came back and said H you know Community doesn't know nothing I gave some posts from the community where they were asking why are you dump it on the head and that's what happens you get a girl and no matter what there's still some people in the cult because ethereum now has a cult and it's like gez I don't know so on Twitter it's going crazy you know and there was some additional notes and I I love what I see I love seeing people turning against this dude and everything he's doing and some good points for me and I wanted to talk about those real quick this won't take long but what was happening was apparently there was another dump of a 100 eth it's not a lot but there was a dump and apparently somebody saw that there was a dump out for Dai and there was somebody actually asked idiot viick directly and he came back and the first word he said was bro so we already know what it is I it does was the guy even born in America I don't know if he was but you're saying bro you are saying bro we know he's getting pissed off he he's about snap you know he's he's getting pissed off he's tired of it it's easy to go away stop doing what you're doing stop dumping on people's heads anyhow some responses talked about you know why aren't you using the chain itself instead of dumping like selling why don't you and somebody said why don't you stake it user Eric Connor who's verified Eric Connor said quote the ethereum foundation could easily stake eat and use defi to cover most if not all their internal budget this is getting extremely tough to defend stop so I don't agree that it could because the budget is lofty someone gave a number like a hundred million dollars to run this business of salary and expenses and overhead so I don't know that staking could get all of it but it brought up an intriguing idea because if your staking is not getting you what you want but it's a viable way to get some then it may encourage you to fix the staking to where you get more right so it gives you an incentive to actually improve the chain and make things better and then idiot Vick chimed back and he was talking about look this the this Foundation is the reason that your fees are down and the reason that that he's defensive he's angry he's pissed because he's attacked meanwhile he's missing the point which is people saying why don't you to stake the right and use that as the revenue stream and then get smarter about how you manage money and get rid of the Dead weight because apparently that's I mean that's bloated if you got A1 million dollars in overhead that's bloated it's crazy and someone else called out how the hell is your budget higher than like har I think it was like Harvard and all the highend classes your budget's higher than  Harvard that's why you're dumping and then you and then somebody else said why don't you just give eth to them as salary and then they can choose to dump it or not but it's better than because I said it's the Optics the this idiot going and doing these bulk sales and then he does it at the time that the price is down which makes it even worse user Eric Connor again came back said quote there should be some type of onchain activ AC ity happening to slow the bleed imagine if that was done from the start you'd have more eth less bad Optics around dumping Etc responding that oh yeah we used the chain and top reasons dumping his tone depth he stop so this Eric Conor he gets it right he gets it he gets the problem the problem is the Optics and there could have been ways to avoided the negative press around what's happening with this guy user Ponzi junkie says quote idiot Vic is embarrassment and it's embarrassment he spelled it wrong for crypto user rart says quote do you want ethereum Foundation to exist forever it's supposed to remove itself with current funds in'll last another decade if E's price remains stagnant so assuming I don't see why they should prolong their life we need a new alternative to the ethereum foundation not putting ethereum foundation on life support user Calvin says quote treding to be quote neutral but instead pissed everyone off LMAO user Eric Sanchez says quote don't worry it's just a quote swap with a laughing uh mean user only. pulse chain says quote some peeps from ethereum Foundation are not necessary user s which is zerox sitama he's actually pretty notorious says quote worst spelled wrong than I thought imagine instead providing D support with eth liquidity enabling them to operate while selling all the way up and collecting fees couldn't be me user 9354 e says quote seems like trying to make eth price go up is an explicit non-goal is ethereum Foundation user Viper nft Says quote do they know you don't have to sell to earn I thought yes but user Amer King says quote it's a good time to talk with boring sluth that's the truth seek guy with the onchain information he has on that foundation so he's calling out some shady business is what it is uses Scarface Tri XX say quote how can these people research a thing they don't use and user leango says quote easy renam to ef. fund that one's great fantastic then somebody quote tweeted a PEC shield message if you heard me on car salesman's project I said when PEX Shield gets involved it usually is indications of a rug pull so you don't want to see it PC shield on the 20th of the month said quote ethereum Foundation has swapped 100 eth for 336,000 da tokens and then showed the Trail user trading act says quote their brains actually do not work at all the  do you need 300,000 for so urgently what could you possibly as the ethereum foundation when the entire world's watching need 300,000 of a public sell order for Mindless dick roaches you us a du9 ycc says quote rug user pass as in pass ET says quote they literally sold because it was going down in recently I don't know who wouldn't do that user Max Magnus says quote the with the the meme of The Cat in the overall saying fck they doing over there you know user dark crypto lar says quote  you idiot Vick in ethereum user Rock predy Says quote I guess that's confirmation there will be no ethereum strategic Reserve today user XP land bread says quote they are probably clapping like a NASA launch too because the stable coin they swap for is decentralized user Davon the DK says quote days since the chain was last successfully used zero so I'm I'm I'm happy and proud that I was able to uh initiate this great Revolt you know this outrage this this this anger I I want it this is what we need because things change when there's Mass disruption and we get everybody on on board to understand the guy's a  idiot I'm I telling you that I've been telling you this right now you understand cuz the dumps kept happening it's not you know it's not just salary it's like dude you're doing it when everything's down which makes no sense and you're not doing anything to help it go up which makes no sense and then the Optics are pissed off and you don't get that either so I'm not telling you what to do with your cash I'm not telling you anything if you support the idiot support the idiots your business the point is people are frustrated people are angry and it's going to keep on happening because he's going to keep on doing it I warned you multiple times you listen to me give my credit cuz now you see it he's that's he's the dumper at this point I henceforth and forth with I'm going to refer to him as idiot Vic the rug puller just like Manny the rug puller because essentially it's like a slow rug I can't describe it any other way how else can you describe it that the damn thing's being suppressed because of these large dumps that he didn't care about if you support him CU you're a s for him have at it but shame on you shame on you for letting him influence you to thinking something other than what's obvious in front of your face you could see for yourself to be the TRU",

to be the truth which is the guy's a idiot that doesn't care about you and so you can make smarter decisions about what you do I can't tell what do your cash but hopefully you'll be smarter hearing what happened recent reports came out allegedly idiot Vick was related to an in some way responsible for I said some way so don't come at me in some way responsible for some of the damage with the gatecoin hack if you're one of those who got into cryptocurrency during the runup of 2021 because you're one of those who buys on the green and so you were not in for a long period of time you have no idea what the gatecoin hack was the gatecoin hack I'm going to give you the very high level and for those that want to come back and say it's wrong I challenge you to go and do your own damn research because you're going to see that everything I say is the truth of what was happening at the time more came out afterwards but at the time what I'm going to say was Tru so the gaycoin hack you may or may not know the history of this crap which is part of the reason many of the large players have not gone full scope into cryptocurrency because of everything that happened with the theum specifically ethereum has a very storied history of sketchy scammy Shady behaviors I would argue ethereum was way more shady than even Bitcoin was in its earliest days you might have heard things like the da the da preceded what we now know of as ethereum I'm sure you know about ethereum classic ethereum classic is actually the original form of ethereum they branched it off they forked it off into this new ethereum the one that got more money dumped into it due to sketchy coordination with some rich players those Rich players then later would dump out as I covered because ethereum's all-time high is about 4,800 bucks and as you see it's nowhere near that that's because people got out of it when they saw that the idiot was dumping on your head ethereum classic has never gotten anywhere close to what ethereum did primarily because of some of this sketchy coordination but also because ethereum classic the regular is basically a crap chain it sucks as a chain step away from all that there prior to what happened to the Dow so the Dow gets hacked and breached which is what spurred the fork prior to this then you have the gay coin 2016 gatecoin hack the gatecoin when we say gatecoin was an actual exchange The Exchange itself got breached at the time they believed that the scope of it was very not so large roughly about you know 8 million dollars 2 million at first8 million determined later but there were Downstream impacts that increased the number to where people came up with estimates somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million not necessarily the three or the eight previously believed at the time of the hack people didn't get their money back with this you have to consider back then there was less known about security and protections and vulnerabilities and everything and so the concept of protections of wallet simply wasn't there a lot of what we take for granted today simply didn't exist so they there's been Evolutions in a lot of the security things you see now I'm not referring to kyc I'm talking about things like you know private Keys being hid by the wallets and that sort of thing a lot of the things we take for granted now are byproducts of what happened on the gatecoin it arguably helped change the industry far the better for security but what it did is it it helped kill the business temporarily prior to the run-ups we would get starting in late 2019 so just to give the history of what that is when I say gatecoin it was an exchange it got breached prior to the Dow which was at the infant stages of what we would now know as ethereum that's the basics high level of what we're dealing idiot vidik of course is part of the ethereum foundation and so he's arguably a spokesperson for what we know of as ethereum now and of course he's an idiot because he talks out of his ass and he doesn't like President Trump well truth Labs which is an on sluth uh on chain rather sleuth an investigator came out on X and made some direct accusations against the idiot apparently they did some analysis going back and some people had talked about you know what was happening with this what was happening with the the Dow hack itself what was happening with the Bitcoin split off when Bitcoin split to bitcoin SV and Bitcoin cash and there's still ongoing like these have not gone away there's still people trying to understand what happened with these Fork offs just like with do rug pull AKA dquan and the Luna ecosystem they've done this analysis to try to determine what happened and they tied it back and what spurred them to start looking deeper in into this was him dumping on your head and some of the piss poor decisions he's been making and him kicking it over to proof of stake instead of proof of work which arguably killed mining profitability I can directly attest to that I digress there's a very comprehensive image about this but the simple statement of what they're alleging is that idiot one of idiot Vick's wallets was a benefactor of this breach that happened that it received some of these funds again this is an allegation I don't have any evidence but they have a graph a visual graph that kind of shows here's where we saw some of this money movement happening during back at that time and it was talking it talks in the context of the eth foundation and you know now that it's you know VI vic. eth right he named it this was prior to the name so you couldn't determine that it was him without doing deeper onchain analysis which is what this uh lab allegedly did to confirm at least to their satisfaction that he was somehow involved as a benefactor to some of the illicit funds that were shifted during this whole situation he's not making an allegation that idiot was the one that did it he's saying that idiot it appears that his wallet was a benefactor of the illicit funds take from that what you will I'm going to close this and not go any further I want you to do your own research on this this person's analysis is on x boring sluth that's his at symbol at boring sluth you can check that out it was posted on January 24th the image is going to be a little bit difficult to follow but he gives a very nice post and he essentially talks about the different funding wallets he talks about the palon ex wallet that was involved he talks about the gatecoin hackers wallet and how there was this interplay and it involved the core ethereum developer Vlad zamir and he's tying it all together but he's basically it's it's inference he doesn't have direct evidence other than this transition that was happening and saying that no vidik was in some way involved he doesn't directly say cause he doesn't do any that stuff he's saying the idiot was involved in some way to one of those hacks that was one of the origins to the disruption of the business that happened where we had the Steep decline prior to the climb again and it connects back when I said the guy keeps dumping on your head and has done for years the guy's a sketchy and I will hope you use this and really study it and make up your own mind about what you do with your cash but I'm just simply saying he's a sketchy that's all I'm saying I'm not accusing them just like they're not accusing anything but it's very interesting and fascinating and I if nothing else I'm hoping I'm hoping that this will cause people to realize the ethereum chain has been influenced since the fork it basically it's been influenced to the negative to benefit certain people's pockets and line this idiot's pockets that's essentially what it is is a very sophisticated pump and dump because it's never gotten back to its all-time high and there was collusion with different developers to help pump certain projects and collusion with certain memes cuz remember there was the allegation on that Leica crap where they said idiot vidic was part and parcel to the rise of a lot of these scam garbage tokens that would happen on the ethereum chain in 2021 so it all kind of comes together in one summary statement which is the guy is a and he's a scammer not as directly scamming you but he's coordinating it in such a professional way that it simply lines his pockets evidenced by the amount of dumps he's doing on you regardless of the new girlfriend as people claimed",

    "title": "PodCast - The Human Side of Vitalik Buterin: Beyond the Founder of Ethereum",
    "content": "all right so today we're going to really dig into ballic butterin oh yeah you know most people probably think of him as like the ethereum guy right the blockchain guy exactly the tech genius but is there more to him you know well yeah I think this interview we're looking at today really gets into that personal side a bit yeah it really does and we're going to get into like his childhood his passions even like how he deals with work life balance you know yeah all that stuff and by the end of this uh deep dive I think you'll not only you know understand vitalic a lot better but maybe you'll find some inspiration for yourself too I think that's a great point I think we put these figures on pedestals sometimes you know and we forget they're human totally so the interview starts off talking about how his family moved from Russia to Canada when he was just six wow can't even imagine yeah it's young adapting to like a whole new world at that age well I mean think about it that's got to contribute to his adaptability right I mean having to navigate a new culture new language completely different environment totally probably you know give him a unique way of looking at the world that willingness to embrace new ideas which is I mean key in the blockchain world yeah absolutely and speaking of thinking differently um the interview talks about how vitalic you know he wasn't into typical kid stuff yeah what was he into like instead of you know sports or whatever he was fascinated by like complex systems oh wow and get Starcraft ah Starcraft you know the video game yeah a classic yeah and he talks about how these games you know they really got him thinking about how systems work like how all the different parts yeah like come together to produce a result interesting it's like he was already training his brain for blockchain without even realizing it it's a great point I mean that's essentially systems thinking right it's about being able to see the big picture how all the pieces connect and interact in the context of blockchain I mean That's essential because you're dealing with this decentralized network transactions being verified secured you know you need to understand the whole ecosystem totally so it wasn't just a you know childhood hobby yeah this fascination with the systems like it actually laid the groundwork for his later work absolutely yeah it's amazing how you know early passions sometimes predict future paths yeah and what I thought was really interesting is that falic is not just this you know that guy right he's got this whole other side to him too the interview talks about how much he loves philosophy and science fiction oh wow travel nature I mean it's like he's this walking contradiction to that stereotype of like the you know Tech obsessed coder yeah and it just shows the depth of his thinking right yeah we assume that to be successful in Tech you have to just focus on that one thing but I think vitalic interests actually enhances work yeah I can see that but does something like science fiction really help you build better Tech well think about it science fiction it pushes the boundaries of what we think is possible Right it encourages us to imagine new worlds new technologies new ways of solving problems and that kind of imaginative thinking is crucial for Innovation you need to be able to see beyond the limitations of the present and explore new territories okay so it's about you know expanding your mental Horizons but what about philosophy yeah how does that play into his work especially something as technical as blockchain well philosophy isn't just about these abstract Concepts right it's about ethics logic reasoning and these are critical When You're Building Technology that has the potential to you know completely change society yeah I mean think about the questions vitalic had to Grapple with When developing ethereum decentralization security accessibility I mean his philosophical background probably really helped him think through these complex issues and design a system that reflected his values so it's a bringing ethics to the tech World exactly not just building things but like considering the impact those things will have on people yeah making sure that technology serves Humanity right not the other way around and this makes me think about like my own work life balance or lack thereof oh yeah even vitalic yeah this leading figure in Tech he admits he struggled with it especially early on with ethereum well it's a common challenge right especially in a field that's constantly you know changing and demanding so much of our time totally but the key is like re recognizing the importance of taking care of yourself absolutely and creating space for things that like recharge you yeah you know it's actually kind of refreshing to hear that someone like falic also fa these challenges yeah makes me feel less guilty about you know my own struggle Paul struggle with it exactly and the important thing is that he you acknowledged the issue and he made changes the interview talks about how he makes time for physical activity oh that's a great meditation dedicated downtime you know to help them stay focused and prevent burnout I love that I'm taking notes Here me too this reminds me of something I read about how important mindfulness is for creative thinking oh yeah for sure but let's get back to vitalic you mentioned earlier something about family being really grounding for him yes tell me more about that well in the interview he talks about how his father actually introduced him to bitcoin oh wow and it was from that initial spark that the idea for ethereum eventually emerged talk about a full circle moment yeah it's like his family played a role in setting him on this path it really shows the impact of those early influences right yeah the people who shape our thinking and even with all his success you know vitelic clearly values those family connections it shows his humility and the importance of staying grounded yeah it's like they provide this balance to the craziness of the tech World exactly it's a reminder that success isn't just about what you achieve professionally it's about the relationships that give our lives meaning you know yeah I love that yeah it's about the people we surround ourselves with absolutely you know it's really interesting to see this more like complete picture of vitalic you know not just the tech stuff but like what he cares about outside of that too yeah absolutely and the interview talks about something I thought was super intriguing like vitalic Legacy what he wants to be remembered for yeah that's a big question right yeah and you can tell he's not in it just to build technology you know for the sake of it right he wants to use his skills to make a difference in the world he talks about you know creating tools that give people more power that kind of level the playing field yeah I mean so much of the tech World feels you know exclusive yeah even intimidating sometimes and it's refreshing to hear someone like falic talking about inclusivity I agree and you know that really connects to his interest in social impact which you see in his work with ethereum yeah how so well one of the core principles is decentralization right right this idea of Distributing power more broadly which totally lines with you know empowering people creating a a fairer Society so it's not just about like the tech itself it's about the potential for social change ex exactly technology is a way to make a better world and this leads to what I think is the most valuable part of the interview his advice for aspiring innovators ooh yeah what's the secret he emphasizes two things challenging assumptions and following your passion I remember him saying like thinking differently but what does that really mean like in practice it means questioning the way things are looking at problems from you know a different angle not being afraid to go against the grain I mean look at how vitalic approached ethereum at the time Bitcoin was like the big thing you know right but vitalic saw the limits he wanted a platform that could do way more than just money transactions support all sorts of decentralized applications so he didn't just accept the way things were he saw a chance to do something different exactly and that's where following your passion comes in because Innovation is not easy right yeah you face challenges setbacks people doubting you oh yeah I've been there but that's where passion keeps you going it gives you the resilience to keep pushing forward to learn from your mistakes and vitalic clearly has that passion he he believes in the power of blockchain to change things for the better it's inspiring to hear that from someone who's accomplished so much you know yeah it's a good reminder that everyone needs that drive to keep innovating absolutely passion is what separates the people who just dip their toes in from those who really commit to making a difference so we've talked about vitalik's childhood his interests his commitment to ethical Tech is advice for innovators yeah it's been great but before we wrap up I want to go back to systems thinking for a minute okay could you break that down a bit more why is it so important for blockchain sure well systems thinking is basically the ability to see how things are connected you know understanding how the different parts of the system interact and influence each other okay and in blockchain That's essential because it's such a complex technology with so many moving parts you've got the decentralized network the cryptography the consensus mechanisms smart contracts all of it it's a lot to really get it you need to see how all these pieces fit together so it's not just knowing the individual Parts it's seeing the big picture the relationships between them exactly and you know this is where vitalik's early interest in complex systems comes in yeah he developed that systems thinking muscle which is so key for navigating blockchain it's amazing how these seemingly like random parts of his life you know playing Starcraft setting philosophy all come together in his work with ethereum it really shows the power of having a multifaceted mind totally it challenges that idea that we need to specialize in one tiny thing to be successful yeah the talet story shows the value of drawing from all sorts of experiences I love that takeaway it's like sometimes our greatest strength come from the unexpected connections we make between things absolutely and that's a great message for anyone really whether you're in Tech or anything else yeah embrace your curiosity explore different things and don't be afraid to you know connect the docks in your own way you never know what incredible ideas might come out of it you know it's kind of wild to think that something as big as ethereum you know yeah started with just someone being curious really shows the power of one person's Vision right totally yeah falic saw a problem had idea and just went for it and ended up changing technology inspiring so many others along the way yeah it's like a reminder that Innovation often comes from people who are willing to challenge the way things are you know absolutely those who aren't afraid to think differently and what's really cool about vitalic is he's not in it for the money or fame right he's not it's about using Tech to empower people yeah to make a more fair and decentralized world that's what makes him different from a lot of tech Figures it's not just about disruption for the sake of it it's about positive change exactly so as we wrap up this deep dive into vitalic I want to leave our listeners with something to think about we've learned about his unique Journey his interests his commitment to ethical Tech his vision for the future right but what can we take away from all this I think the biggest thing is the power of curiosity and Having the courage to think differently yeah falic Story shows us that Innovation often starts with questioning things you know challenging assumptions exploring New Perspectives it's about always being open to learning and growing exactly and realizing that all those passions we have even the ones that seem totally unrelated to our work they can make us better thinkers and lead to breakthroughs we never expected so as you go about your day try to channel your inner vitalic oh I love that ask yourself what needs a fresh perspective in your life what assumptions are holding you back H what are you passionate about that could fuel your own Innovation yeah yeah what could be your contribution to the world because just like falic you have the potential to create something amazing absolutely well that's it for our Deep dive into vitalic butterin thanks for having me thanks for listening and we'll see you next time",

    "content": "hi everybody uh my name is Yosef welcome to this session uh we're going to do a Q&A with Jeff Jeff do you want to share a little bit about yourself so my name is Jeff Coleman um if you've seen me on social media it's probably on Twitter as techn crypto or sometimes jeff. eth um I'm someone who's been in the blockchain space for about 13 years now uh first Bitcoin when this guy came along and said hey this ethereum thing I was like oh that's interesting so that became a pretty full-time interest of mine um I'm a technologist a researcher um worn many other hats over the years but I'm also very passionate about connecting the global ethereum Community into the local community in places like Acra and elsewhere um there's been a bit of a gap there um and it's a a bridge that we need to make stronger and and connect better as a community so thanks Jeff and our travel blogger vitalic do you want to share something and I also co-founded Bitcoin magazine but um yeah know so I am you know do ethereum things I think these days I do a combination of like some protocol level research and development work but also kind of coordinating across you know different people and the ecosystem ler and trying to figure out like what are all of the different pieces that need to be done to really make ethereum um you know useful for billions of regular people and uh trying to you do my part to help um make sure that all those different pieces happen thanks for talex and my name is ysf um my role I wear multiple hats one of which is helping build a bridge between Global ethereum communities and African communities um and also on a mission to have more African Builders African Educators so that we build the solutions that we want with blockchain Technologies um and achieve the vision of more than a billion users because we can actually use these uh trust coordination layers for a lot of our needs um so I think we're going to jump into questions uh who has questions to ask the panel here great while you all get set up I'm going to ask viic the first question tell us for people who are kind of new to ethereum can you give us a little bit about what ethereum is uh how it's set up and what makes it different from other change that some of us hear about sure so I usually describe ethereum as a general purpose blockchain right so you know a blockchain you know we all know this kind of decentralized computer network whose job it is to keep track of and come to agreements on data and events that happened and who did different things at particular times it's a a kind of network that's useful for applications like money but it's also used for many very useful for many other kinds of applications as well and the ethereum project basically started out of this desire to take what's already been done in the blockchain space with Bitcoin and with a couple of other projects that were focused on one application and try to build something general purpose so you could expand that create a platform that brings the same benefits and lets you create the a global open transparence permission less applications for like any any use case that you can come up with that makes sense to to do on a blockchain at all right so the project started at the end of 2013 it's been um the chain launched in 2015 the chain has been running for over seven and a half years now um for about five months it's now been running as a proof of stake chain which you know has been I think wonderful for the ecosystem um but in terms of like what makes ethereum different I think uh there's different answers that depend on like what you're comparing it to and like what aspects of it that you care about right like it's possible to compare ethereum to bitcoin it's possible to compare ethereum to cardano it's possible to compare ethereum to the AI industry right it's uh possible to compare Bitcoin to traditional silicon valy tech companies right um it's possible to you know compare it to like part like like parts of governments right and depending on like what metaphor you take or like what aspect that you care about I think the answer often ends up you know being different but one of the common factors is how we really value decentralization and we really value um you know ethereum not just as a technology but as a sort of community where we have lots of different people from many different parts of the world with you know lots different expertise and experiences coming together in this ecosystem where anyone is uh you know free to enter and uh you know become part of it whether that means being part of running the network whether that means running an building an application um whether it means participating in the ecosystem some other way right like really value doing the best that we can to be this network where like really anyone can participate at any part of the deack it's something that does not depend on this kind of small centralized group of people um in order to operate like even the ethereum foundation itself right we kind of really believe in decentralization at an organizational level um so for example the foundation spends more money on grants than it does on paying its own employ right so we actually try to kind of distribute power to and agency kind of to the edges and to Independent groups who um you know know what they're doing in many cases better than we do as much as possible um and you know ethereum is this know very big and International Community of uh people who are building applications you know all and just all kinds of things on top of the technology right it includes you know Finance the defy with saving money and moving money across borders it includes things like nfts um non-financial applications things like ens um you know different um different kinds of Records um identity and like reputation related applications Dows these kind of communities of of people that are managing assets by using rules that are encoded on programs on the blockchain like all of these things and you know there's a really big Community that's building lots of applications in each one of those areas and I know this is the community that I think like as as a foundation we try to do um the best that we can to support thank you um quick question to you all who's building uh a project on the ethereum network here raise your hand maybe could you all just stand up so we we see you all cool awesome uh how many people here are developers uh either at the application or protocol level on ethereum including layer 2s raise your hand really high okay cool um so just wanted to open it up to questions that people have here that would like to ask to Vell or Jeff hi yes thank you so much and thanks for your team my question question is straight to you and vitalik um so if you consider Africa as far as blockchain is concerned I've always said it's a need in Africa whil it's a want in the west it's easier to send a dollar to somebody in San Francisco from um The W other place of us that it is from Ghana to Togo so if you look at blockchain and it's applications rather instead of concent more in the Asian region and North America what is the strategy for ethereum as far as Africa is concerned because I know from East Africa central Africa South Africa West Africa especially Nigeria young people are building stuff but there's no support this not a missionary approach wo run bear people are building stuff on ethereum but if you look at the the infrastructure as it is the support has been in Asia and North America what's strategy as far as Africa is concerned you have a continent 1 billion people in the next 6 years 0 to 30 this is where the use of blockchain is so what's your strategy for Africa thank you je can you uh that's a great question um I'll answer in several parts so uh first of all I'm going to talk a little about how I got into the community um so uh before blockchain was ever thing um I was living in Ethiopia for a while I lived there for about 10 years I went to school in Kenya and U when I first heard about blockchain I immediately thought exactly what you said like a lot of these abstract ideas that people have around blockchain oh maybe it's useful for this maybe it's useful for that in much of the global Earth it's a theory and and part of that theory is a narrative that says oh it'll be useful for financial equality it'll be useful for Access but it's very theoretical um and to get to the second part of your question um I have to add one little explanation which is you know one of the differences between the ethereum community and a lot of the other communities is that the ethereum community is very spread out and everything that happens in ethereum is managed by primarily the community it's not uh just the ethereum foundation that does everything so I'm I'm not a member of the ethereum foundation uh Yos is not a member of the ethereum foundation um in a lot of these other protocols the the crowd sale goes directly into the foundation the foundation runs everything that's not how it is in ethereum so when I hear the question What is ethereum strategy I I ask what's the ethereum community strategy and I think that the simplest answer is it's been lacking it hasn't been there right I I think like there's many many factors in in what this has been but for a long time this idea of actually using blockchain in places that matters has been lacking um and some of the reasons for that have been about the rapid growth of the protocol raising fees to a level where the protocol is inaccessible that's been a big priority for people who are working on the core level trying to make that better trying to scale ethereum trying to get it so to the point where we have rule ups and things that bring cost down so that people can use it but I think because of that and because of other systemic issues in in the ethereum community uh there's been been excuses um about why that Global Community has been mostly concentrated in these other places and when the communities exist here they don't get the access and support that they need um so the other thing that I'd like to say to response to that is I hope that this is changing right and uh it's coming from behind I think there's a lot of work to do I think like the global thether Community has not shown up on the continent the way that they need to um part of the purpose of this trip why we we're spending a month here um is to try and start that bridge and to start expanding that because in ethereum you can't just have the foundation decide to fix that it's the broader ethereum Community needs to come here connect here be plugged in when people are working on projects here they need to have that access they need to have that support part of that is about spending time together and just getting to know each other but part of that is also about the physical times that we connect you know the major events for the ethereum community have been held in places that are often hard to get visas to they're hard they're expensive to travel to there's all these barriers in place and I think there needs to be a lot of work to systematically break those barriers down um so across the Spectrum how that needs to play out is one more interpersonal contact because you know it's a wonderful that V Talk's here but the foundation um by itself cannot fix this problem the community as a whole needs to address this so we need to get more interpersonal contact get people plugged into those projects and then we need to get get people thinking um the opposite way around you know ysf had a great point that uh in some ways is kind of like the founding theme for this trip which is it's not that Africa needs ethereum it's that ethereum needs Africa this is the place where the young Talent is growing up this is where new people are this is where there's so many new developers and technologists and innovators and exactly like you said before a lot of these ideas of what blockchains are useful to solve are very theoretical in the global North they're very abstract they're very nice to have they're not have to have and because of that if you just take those ideas and try to transport them here they'll fail which is great because there are enough ideas here that need to succeed and the ideas here are in contact with actual problems with actual situations that people are facing they're designed to address actual issues and in my my view that's what blockchain is really all about so what I would like to see is is a a reversal of that scenario and the the pipeline of information we need to build is for people around the world who are not plugged into local communities here to become informed because they're presently ignorant and they have a lot of abstract projects that maybe don't make sense that they need to loosen their grip on and take a look at what people are building here that's that's my answer one quick thing I'd like to add to what Jeff said um I think also like having communities here connect with one another to create enough of a gravitation Point uh I was quite surprised just how many different sub communities even exist in Acra uh that we're kind of getting to meet individually so I hope you all use this space to do that um and you know I've heard of initiatives such as uh eth arra that want to happen I think it' be really amazing to make something like that a success and for the local community to Rally around and you know those of us who are either bridge building or some of us who are in the global etherum Community can plug in and and support that so I think the more there's connectivity within the local community it makes it a lot easier to then communicate to the rest of the world how to approach and think African ecosystems because what Global Builders are optimizing for is very different what you're optimizing for because the conditions are very different and I think that requires a little bit of education and baby handholding uh but I'm sure I think we can get to that point um I think just kind of follow up a bit right like a big part of the purpose of this trip for us I think is kind of help us understand and form concretely you know what the Africa strategy should be in the future and I think as far like as far as the answers that we have I just support supporting local groups and identifying you know which are the local groups that can make the best use of support is a big part of it right and know we've definitely made some contacts you know both here and in Kenyon and other places another really big part of the answer is layer twos right and I thinker two are part of the answer for two reasons one part of the reason is is that a big part of the reason why ethereum the blockchain has not been succeeding in like pretty much every you know low income country in region for the last few years is basically fees right so I spent a bunch of time in Argentina and other Latin American countries uh you know over the last year and a half and uh that like I've seen some of this personally right like I remember visiting some places in buen Osiris like there was a coffee shop that accepted Bitcoin there were some Cur or or they accepted every cryptocurrency there were some currency exchangers that accepted cryptocurrencies and when I looked and saw you know the QR code that they showed me they had a binance account I sent them some eth and the transaction took a couple of minutes to process um by the way um that like that's actually one piece of UI that has improved over the last year and a half right over about a year and a half transactions would often take many minutes to process but now a lot of the time they just reliably get included in six seconds right and like eap1 1559 and the merge I think like deserve a lot of credit for that like these are actual ethereum protocol changes that made you user experience of the blockchain better in you know real ways that people can understand and like that's a kind of victory that I think we wants to double down on and like have five more victores like that right but the main thing other that is just a fees right so sending that transaction from me to this wallet took I think it was like a150 right and and the other time I sent to I sented the transaction fee was something like $330 right these are numbers that are totally um possible to forget if you are a person in a rich country who has also been part of the crypto space since 2014 and so you already have a pile of Bitcoin and eth if you're just someone coming into the ecosystem even these numbers are you know the difference between cryptocurrency being viable and cryptocurrency being not viable and transaction fees being high are like a problem that today binance as a wallet basically fixes for a lot of people right like in Argentina most people just use binance wallets and people are used to binance to binance transactions zero transaction V and they instant I think we've seen the uh you know the Perils of using a totally centralized and uh and a service and thinking that you can trust it just because it's a run by a very charismatic person who wears a suit and goes to goes on panels with Bill Clinton and has face you his face up everywhere in San Francisco um but so we want the decentralized approaches to win right but the reality is that centralized approaches have this good ux and as a decentralized ecosystem we have to match that ux right so speed of transaction inclusion and fees and layer two's Sol fees right like layer 2s are the way that ethereum is scaling and on layer 2os already transaction fees are somewhere between five and 10 times lower than they are on layer one and with EIP 4844 and with future changes the plan is for layer fees on layer 2 is to go even lower on inclusion speed Lear 2s have this concept of pre- confirmations right where you can get some like a kind of confirmation that your transaction got accepted often much faster than ler one scan and this is also a very big and Powerful benefit to users right so as a technology L 2s are the thing that the only thing that can make using ethereum convenient and affordable um but also ler tws are important because of the community and talent that they bring right so optimism arbitrum polygon Stark net ZK sync Tao right all of these systems that are you know they that are the technology that can make ethereum affordable to um you know regular users around the world and actually and convenient and they are the groups that are often doing this a lot of this kind of very direct user and developer Outreach right and I think they are the group that like ultimately also need like really needs to have stronger links between um you know Africa and the and the layer two teams and between other parts of the world and the ler two teams as well thank you um I think there's a question here yep one of the things that spared a lot of uh building in the crypto space is publica good funding and gitcoin has been a a very key um player in that field um to the extent where even Innovations like Unis swap um have their root um um tied to getcoin one way or the other now personally I've had this experience where I've tried a couple of times to list project on gitcoin and the process has been hectic and it hasn't been successful and I I know a couple of developers that have presented their project also and it hasn't been successful so um I'm happy that you are on the ground in Africa and you've seen a lot of things you've learned a lot of things I am Keen to pick your brain on a a possible public good funding mechanism that can be implemented in Africa so that is the first question the second question is that um most of these protocols or projects or ecosystems have sub communities in Africa right and you spoke about um decentralized grants in the sense that you don't actually the you don't have connection to the ethereum foundation but they give out grants Etc it's always difficult for Africans or African projects or communities to get access to this grand staff so I guess um how do we bridge that Gap does subow concept help with that that is the the the question where we can have um sub Dows connected to Major um Dows that can help facilitate coordination in that aspect the third question is actually uh contract secured Revenue um can we Implement is there a possibility that we can implement this in major protocols where these revenues generated can be Fel to some places in Africa to help developers to here so that is my questions yeah I think um with with with public goods funding mechanisms like I personally you know am don't yet understand well you know like what the particular errors that people have been seeing here uh trying to get into the gcoin gcoin ecosystem but I think you know what but know a big part of that solution just you know has to I think involve just better links between the between the you know gcoin community and local people here that are trying to get on that right so that's also something that you know I hope is going to start happening soon um and then but aside from that like my opinion is that public goods like it's generally better for public goods spending mechanisms to be diverse and getcoin is one thing and I think uh improving gitcoin and you know making gitcoin really live up to its promise is really important but it's also not the only thing right there's uh often you know a lot of kind of local community organizations and local Dows that do public goods funding and that's uh also something that I think needs to be supported much more um there's uh in optimism or retroactive public goods funding is uh another good example right they're in the process of doing round two but the uh you know they're only getting a very particular sample of uh projects that uh to that are being rewarded by round two right and that's something where I think uh like another example of something where I think just like kind of stronger connections between the communities need to be made and like in a lot of these cases um you know like ultimately I think it makes sense to make these public goods funding mechanisms more kind of localized and kind of multi-level right like one thing in the middle is never going to be able to properly you know fund all of the public goods everywhere um but um you know if you have a larger set of local things that are run by different groups of people then like that creates a larger chance that everything that needs to be funded actually is going to be covered in some way right so like right now that's what I hope to see more like I hope to just see more variety in public goods Funding Solutions and um you know I hope to see both the existing ones and the new ones try to get more support I'd like to chime in bit on gitcoin because you're absolutely right and this is a symptom of what we were discussing earlier because I've been involved with with gitcoin not like I don't work with for gitcoin but I've been involved in that Community for a long time I've contributed to a lot of rounds I'm I'm really fascinated by that project but there is an incredible underrepresentation of African projects and and some other categories on there and uh where does that come from um you correctly identified that the first hurdle is getting listed in the first place place and uh one of the biggest barriers that starts there and continues throughout the process is when people have a lack of personal connection to a community they recognize that they have an ignorance they recognize that they don't know the difference between quality projects and poor quality projects and scams but they stop there if they don't have a point to follow up on and I've seen with so many projects that try to get listed and and what they're trying to do is they're just trying to say no we're a legitimate project and whoever's engaging with them is saying I don't know anything about the space I don't know who these people are and things like this they correctly identify that that they're ignorant about that but then they don't have a next step to follow up on and in my mind the obvious next step is you should connect with someone in that Community to find out if this is a legitimate project right and that's what I'm talking about with building these Bridges um if if you want people to be able to have that access uh you have to take them and them meet people they can be meeting people online they can be participating online in those communities to get to know people they can be coming to events and again if the events they're going to are events that people from here can't get visas to attend of course they're not going to be meeting the members of the local community there so again one solution is you can flip that and have events here people from there can often get visas to attend here that's an easier solution to the Visa problem if you if you're coming and you're meeting people and you're talking to people even if you haven't met that specific project you have a point of contact of say oh this person would probably know about that I can ask them if this is a legitimate project and when you proceed to the next level let's say you you manage to do that you manage to say oh this person knows me you know I can show you my GitHub I can show you enough evidence that I'll get listed as a project you face the same problem multiplied across all of the gitcoin funders because every individual person who goes to donate that website they're looking at different projects and they're like I don't know which one is a good project to support because again they don't have that personal connection and so I've said it several times now but that personal connection is the foundation of of addressing that it's not the complete solution because even as you build that out that that existing distribution of the community is going to be biased even if somebody is going to events and getting plugged in they're spending more time around other people that they're closer to and they're just going to be thinking of those project first and we do see that projects that people are familiar with and know about get more funding just because people know about them and so the other thing we have to do is we have to build that pipeline into an amplification process where once people know about a local project here they're they're amplifying they're spreading it out to people who don't already have that personal connection and and they're they're sharing it around even that is not going to be perfect um I've talked to several projects here who have been listed on gitcoin and uh what they've discovered is that the amount of support they get through there is very variable one time uh there'll be a lot of attention they'll get a lot of support and they'll get a big amount of funding the next time it doesn't show up it's not consistent so it can't be the basis of everything but within the mechanism that gitcoin is I think we can improve that mechanism quite a bit by increasing the amount of contact between the global community and the local community here of course the other things that V talk mentioned are also very important too uh this is one area I am U working to help bridge but it's just one solution so as vitalic said I think it would be amazing for more local projects entities being set up to even get closer to the more Grassroots initiatives I think we got to yeah we got to help bridge a lot of those worlds and I hope the tide is is Shifting and I think more local Gatherings and events and all of that that help create a gravitation Point uh are valuable um questions cool oh okay the mic is with you and then yes the next question uh hi Miss purple again so my question is more I'm since we talked about Community a bit outside of the developments in ethereum so outside of EIP 1559 the merge and the Shanghai update what on the social layer are you most excited about um you know coming in the next I guess maybe year or next few years um and perhaps just to kind of add on to that do we have the right amount of the right people that we need within the community and within the ecosystem or is there a Gap Gap that still needs to be filled I think the the the there is still a gap on the ux side right like uh if we look at wallets you know there's metamask and there's a few other things but there probably should be more things um if you look at uh wallet like making it easier for people to have you know self-hosted wallets that are actually secure without risking um you know losing all their money if they forget their 12-word passphrase right like you know there is EIP ERC 4337 there is social recovery and there is ganos to sa and there is all these things but like we need user interfaces and we need to build wallets that actually use these things um wallets that actually do a good job of uh interfacing between different layer twos right like and I think also uh for there's there are existing companies that are making wallets and like people that are doing these things but often they're like not close enough to to different kinds of user groups right like uh I ask some of them you know how are you testing whether or not your social recovery implementation is easy to use and the answer is like oh I ask my my non- crytal friend right and like that's better than asking the like their their employee but at the same time like that's still only one type of non-crypto friend and like it's still a very kind of you know biased and kind of limited sample of the kinds of people that could benefit from wallets with better uox um so the I guess the social part of that like um really is actually um you know helping these projects and make sure that the direction that they're building is a direction that like actually improves the user experience of people who that need better user experience the most uh speaking of social communities um I think like the simple answer to your question is there a Gap yes there's still a gap there's many different types of categories of people who have an incredible amount to contribute and yet don't have a natural niche and the best way that I can uh give an example that is to go back in time and talk about the rise of nfts because when nfts came along um there were a lot of people who were previously working on like technology type areas who were able to participate but there was also a whole new range of people who were like hey this is actually a space for me where I can get into this and and contribute and engage and it's been amazing for me to see the amazing communities that have grown out of that that have reached into other areas and are we done with that no of course not there are many other areas like this uh now the question of how we reach out and connect with them is a a combination one obviously um we need to find things that are actually useful for people to engage with when we we build a technology and it doesn't actually serve a need that someone has then unless they're personally interested in or personally fascinated by it why do they even want to become part of that Community right but the other the other part of it is just about once you have identified something and you know that it fits there's so much noise in this space right there's so much going on I think like a lot of people have probably encountered scams they have family members who their only experience of of blockchain or crypto is an experience of of something really scammy and the the ability to wait through that differs a lot depending on the kind of person you are and the type of Engagement the type of knowledge that you have so some of that needs to needs to be addressed by um becoming more um open as a community about the ways that we distinguish those I think a lot of times when you have somebody who's who's uh proceeded further in their journey and they've learned a lot um they become more of an expert themselves and so they get past the point that they are no longer taken in by a lot of these scams um but but if you turn out and look around the people who haven't Advanced to that point they're very vulnerable to a lot of this stuff and and the ramp between the the level of of expertise and knowledge that required to to be fairly safe from a lot of that that noise and when you're just starting in is a really long one and and that ramp needs about as much support as we can possibly give it because people need to to climb up that to get to a place where they're not going to be easily taken in by things and if we want different kinds of people to be able to contribute in our communities we need to make it safe for them so that that I think is another big part of it who hears from University University students okay uh I know some had questions for us um back there yep my name is Samuel um my question is about ZK technology um recently it's like everybody's kind of talking about it like in the developer community so I wanted to ask B if he can share more knowledge on that what are the possible use cases and should I right into it as a student someone learning also and building the community I think the the answer is absolutely yes um so just to uh briefly explain what ZK technology is to people who haven't like fully U who who haven't heard of it deeply before so it stands for zero knowledge proofs and it's basically a way to make proofs about information that you have without revealing fully revealing the information that you're making proofs about right so uh I like even just like a signature is actually a very simple like special purpose type of Zer knowledge proof right because it's basically a proof that says I control this private key but without actually giving up the private key so so someone anyone else can use it right um and zero knowledge proofs do things with like just any kind of data in general right so if for example you want to prove that you know the solution to a math problem then you can make a proof where the program that you're proving like takes the solution that you know it checks that the solution is correct and the proof only verifies if the solution is correct right you brought you you send someone that proof and they know that you have a solution but the proof only tells them that the solution is correct it doesn't tell them what the solution is this is a very powerful technology because I think it really kind of combines together well with a lot of blockchains weaknesses right because blockchains are a technology that gives these really powerful properties they let you build applications that are open permissionless Global transparent censorship resistant all of these things but they sacrifice two very big things they sacrifice privacy and they sacrifice scalability zero knowledge proofs give you back privacy and the kinds of zero knowledge proofs that have been developed very recently that are called Zas arcs also give you backs scaleability right so one of the reasons why Zars are powerful is because it's it's much faster to verify a proof of a computation than it is to run the computation self and so this make makes them useful for scaling ethereum all of the CK rollups use them and the Privacy side is really useful for solving some of the Privacy challenges on ethereum right so if you wants to prove something about yourself like he wants to prove some like some kind of calculation about your reputation he wants to transfer some coin or like some asset in a privacy preserving way if you want to do lots of things then you can do it in a way that gives that still is on chain gives you the benefits of being on chain but avoids creating this kind of public link where you reveal every to everyone everything about the the action that you're taking and zero knowledge proofs are the technology that lets you do that right um so like if someone's a developer and they wants a kind of a guide to like how to use your knowledge proofs and some applications um on my blog V alc.ca I recently I think about half a year ago wrote this article um I think it was something like applications of Zars for privacy like if you just go to the site and you can troll off for privacy then you can probably find it and like there's applications like a coin um transfer system a reputation system a negative reputation system privacy preserving Doss protection like a lot um a lot of interesting stuff uh privacy preserving voting is uh in there too right like a lot of like these really powerful things can be done with a combination of blockchains and zero knowledge proofs so if someone is interested in that area I definitely encourage people to know um get into zero knowledge proofs and try to build applications that use them thank you uh I'm so sorry there's a guy behind you from University had a question so we'll come back to you uh hello everyone my question is I want vitalic to explain me what is 51 attack okay um so a so 51% attacks are this really important Concept in blockchains right so I think so first of all just stepping back a bit right like what do blockchains do blockchains are an engine for agreeing on stuff when the thing that you're agreeing on is a thing that can be kind of understo by a by a live running system but it's not something you can matically Pro directly right so a big example of this is what's called the double spending problem let's say I have 100 coins and everyone agrees that I have 100 coins but then I create and sign a transaction that sends 100 coin coins to Chica and then I create and sign another transaction that sends the same 100 coins to Jeff and I broadcast both of these transactions in order to have a functioning monetary system it should not be possible for both of these to succeed right because if they succeed then I've turned 100 coins into 200 coins so what a blockchain does is it agrees on order so the blockchain makes comes to some agreement on which of these two transactions it sees first it accepts that one and it rejects the other one right so this is what blockchains do and this is why blockchains can be the backbone of digital currencies and other things while like the bitor network for example cannot be the backbone of a digital currency right now what is a 51% attack now in order for the blockchain to kind of come to an agreement on these uh like which of these two transactions came first there is there needs to be some kind of voting procedure right it's so it's this very decentralized system and you have a large number of computers all around the world and they're performing the task of voting to agree on did we see this transaction first or did we see this transaction first right there's rounds of voting sometimes multiple rounds sometimes it gets complicated but eventually they reach an agreement this voting procedure has an assumption which is that the majority of people participating are honest right and if the majority participating are not honest then you could have a situation where they lie right so for example what they could do is they could first come to an agreement that my transaction T chica came first but then that same group could later on if also come to an agreement that says that my transaction coming to Jeff succeeded and when they when that happens this is called a reor right a reorganization where the block that contains the transaction from myself going to chica gets thrown away it's no longer part of the chain anymore and the block that contains the transaction going from me to Jeff gets accepted and becomes accepted as being part of the new chain right now normally blockchains are kind of like convergent right so once they agree on something they keep agreeing to it and there's even mathematical proofs that say if either like 51% or 66% depending on the assumptions like if the majority of the participants in the system are honest then once the system agrees on something it sticks to that agreement and it doesn't go back right there is this concept property called finality that like ethereum really cares about but if this honesty assumption does not hold right and if the majority of participants that are doing this voting are dishonest then they can agree on something and then later change their mind and then agree on something else right and like that process like this idea that a dishonest majority can just change its mind it can block transactions it can do all of these nasty things that completely violate what a blockchain is supposed to do like that's what a 51% attack is right and a big part of the job of a consensus protocol is to try to make 51% attacks as um difficult and as expensive for the attacker as possible thank you I'll take two more questions from University students and then we'll go back to the General Public okay yeah um my question is directed at velic so I read the infinite machine and in it ca mentions that you took a sub article from your University education um traveled the world um spend some time building um a couple of crypto projects before and then are co-founding ethereum with a couple of friends my first question then is did you go into that saat account know you are going to co-found ethereum if not do you think you would have stumbled around into eventually build an ethereum I don't think I would have stumbled into ethereum on my own right um so the thing that really inspired creating ethereum was uh going around in the world and seeing the projects that other people were working on already right so in particular when I was visiting Israel in October 2013 there there's a lot of very smart mathematicians in Israel and a lot of people working on like these really interesting and really Advanced crypto projects right so CED coins and master coin were probably the top two and covered coins is this protocol for releasing assets on a blockchain and uh mastercoin is this protocol for not just issuing your own assets but also doing more complicated Financial transactions between them right and I looked at these projects I was even working for both of these projects at the time and I started order to see the opportunities for how to make something like Master coin more general purpose while still like keeping even making it simpler at the same time right replace two features with one feature that does the thing that two of them do and then does even more and like it was that Chain of Thought that eventually led to creating ethereum as a completely separate system right so I think interacting with stuff that other people are building that is on the frontier is like I think it's necessary part of uh you know getting to the point of uh creating something that is um that is on the frontier yourself so it's like that kind of direct interaction I think is a form of Education that I highly encourage thank you I'll take one question from uh some of the students on that side my name is Antony one ke application of the blockchain is its ability to provide a d dless and decentralized system so how do you see the blockchain be applied in the future Beyond Finance considering considering the role of government in defending ownership how do we see the um the use of blockchains Beyond Finance do you want to take that one um specifically uh uh looking at this question of how governments are participating in ownership this is a really important question um you know uh one of the reasons that there's a lot of empis on tokens and currencies and blockchains is because the token itself is the ownership right the thing that you own is the only thing that you need that your balance your number that's the only thing that's trying to be preserved when you're talking about ownership of other assets that exist in the physical world you know the blockchain is just math how are you going to build a connection between that physical item and and and this abstract mathematical system and whatever your answer is it's going to be some type of social system and this is where governments are very important because uh a government is usually the place where we as a society coordinate to build these kinds of social systems that allow us to say what we mean by ownership is that you have some type of right or what we mean by rental or what we mean by by assignment or whatever the property is that you have some kind of right that's recognized by other human beings and when that right is infringed upon there's some process that you can use I think that that um whatever the the name of that system is it has to exist and and uh it's very hard to imagine a system that that does all of those things that wouldn't be called some type of system of government now there are many interesting ideas that people have around blockchains about creating things that bring in that social aspect about have people respond and and react sometimes you can have incentives and financial and economic incentives that offer a financial penalty or or some some kind of financial record that that turns into a credit score or something like this that can start to have an impact on that but in many cases at the end of the day what you need is a a local agreement between people who are in the same physical space about how you're going to treat an object and by the time you get to that level of integration with the community um it's about being in consensus with your your local neighborhood with your local country with the people who are physically close to you about how you're going to treat things and even if the way that you're going to treat things is going to involve something like a block chain technology if you're going to for example if you're going to take a land registry and and authenticate that registry using keys that are stored on a blockchain or that any process of modification has to somehow be registered in some public way through a blockchain even if you're socially agreeing to that process the legitimacy of that process will be decided on by how people around you view that system if they don't like it they might overthrow it and change it right so this this relationship between mathematical system like blockchains and social systems which is usually where government is involved is very critical and uh personally I'm not of the opinion that we should assume blockchain can replace everything I think we need to look at each situation and look at the value that blockchain brings and look at the relationship with that local system like a government and decide what the trade-offs are what the benefits are what parts of blockchain can be introduced to add legibility to add legitimacy but not all of that is going to be in the code a lot of that is going to be in the community and the community's decision of what's important and what's valuable um in the same way that that a government has this question of legitimacy it has the question of do people think the government is legitimate will they do what the government says what will they do when the government wants to do something and they don't agree the same questions all exist for for blockchain Technologies applied outside of the digital realm so it's a very broad topic uh and I think there's a lot of interesting things to be said there but at the end of the day whatever system is and however it does or doesn't use blockchain technology it's really a social process it's really about how people human beings in the same physical space agreed to do something and the tool of blockchain can be useful in that process but somehow people still have to do that job of coordinating good time for a few more questions uh we've heard from a lot of men today it would be amazing to hear from women can you please uh give the microphone to chica in front here so this is a question for everybody um so I think recently we've been talking a lot about how web 3 blockchain crypto is all things that are actually needed here on the continent right and that we are actually a great case study for the reason why this was created in the first place um one of the things I think that not talked about enough is the fact that Africans are naturally communal um we have a lot of practice that make us communal in nature um and that we actually depend on our community so I'm I'm curious around specifically around Dows um and coordination what is exciting you about in the space um and if you have seen even examples on your trip around how that can be applied to Dows and how people from the West can learn from us around just our communal practice I'm happy to jump in on that one um I I think you're completely right and we've just been talking about that relationship of the local community to a process to assign legitimacy to decide how to coordinate and there are an enormous number of structures that do that and they're not all governments right um I I've seen an incredible number of examples of this um and and an aspect of this that I think is particularly exciting is when you look at an institution that um is is a a community tool for coordination and it might have a financial aspect so um there are a lot of places that have uh groups that do savings there are a lot of places that have groups that perform some kind of risk uh protection whether it's for medical or emergency issues or provide some kind of liquidity for people who are starting businesses loans in the community whatever those processes are oftentimes you'll look at that process and if if you're not too familiar with it you look at it as a financial process and there is often a financial element but what you're also seeing is a community process and the community aspects are often from my perspective even more important than the financial aspects I've seen a lot of examples where some somebody will look at a project like that and say oh we could put that on a blockchain and we could copy the financial flows and they really pay attention to the financial structure of it and the finance is often important and relevant but there's a community structure around that that has a richness and a complexity that's very difficult to encode in a series of rules and one thing that I'm very excited about is people looking at groups like that not trying to take that Financial structure and just pull it out put it on a blockchain and and put 10,000 people in it that aren't going to have the same community that aren't going to have the same uh understanding of each other that aren't going to have the same process of building trust that aren't going to have the same mechanisms for assessing risk for understanding the difference between like a circumstance that's beyond a person's control and an instance of fraud or misbehavior all those felties that make these communities work instead what I think is fascinating is to look at that that architecture of of trust in the community itself as a resource and I I would love to see more projects that instead of trying to extract the financial part of that and turn it into 20 lines of code on the blockchain look at at taking blockchain projects and plugging them into these communities to make the blockchain project better and and specifically one of the biggest challenges we've been talking about usability is if you're in a a decentralized system and something goes wrong if you you lose your device you forget your password whatever your process is what are you going to do typically in the centralized world we say that you just call support and figure it out which doesn't always work sometimes support isn't available and people aren't responsive especially if the platform you're using is some Mega International Tech corporation that doesn't value you as an individual but either way when we build a new system we have to have some process and if that process is naive if it's just there's one key and if you ever forget it you lose everything that's not practical that's not useful for people so I'm very fascinated by the idea of using these Comm communities and the existing trust architecture the fact that they know each other the fact that they they know what to do when something goes wrong the fact that they have some kind of structure to how they organize and and and arrange themselves I would be very interested in using that as a strategy to do things like account recovery to do things like onboarding when you're just coming into blockchain you don't need to like learn all the math and all the keys and all the things at once you can have something that starts small and then scales up with a level of Finance but usually that requires some level of human judgment and the people who are best at doing that human judgment are probably your local community who knows you and understands you and when something goes wrong you can go to them and say hey I lost my device can we get together and do this recovery process like the social recovery that balica has mentioned or something like that but but wrapped up in the the methods and and ways that those people already do things I think that could be incredibly useful and I think it it could flip this this architecture upside down of instead of having people only plug into the blockchain it's the blockchain that's plugged into these communities and these communities are the things that make the blockchain useful for more than just Financial applications uh so s was sitting right next to you um has been doing a lot of work in this space and one of the things that she keeps talking about is that um so much of the focus in the Dow space is on the uh like blockchainbased collective decision making but 95% of the work is actually in the human way not not on the software and I think that's something that a lot of dows that are trying to build community really struggle with is the jump super quick around the Dow tooling and all of that without figuring out the human element of it and so whenever you're going to communities that already have a shared set of values shared understanding what they're trying to do and all of that it becomes a lot easier to build all the other components of it because ultimately so much of our society is used to extremely hierarchical ways of working and trying to build a culture of working and thriving and D formats is actually quite hard uh there's a bit of unlearning that's needed and and I see different communities really struggling without doing the work of actually figuring that as the human element out so I mean you know that's one thing that I I respect of what you two are doing is you're spending a lot of time on the human and connective and Community element of it and I think that's really what makes community last over a long period of time um there was one question over there and we'll we'll come to you so gentlemen hello my name is Andrew and um my question is mainly based on um the recent events that have happened in the crypto space so um looking at what happened to FTX and what happened to the Luna coin yeah a lot of people have doubts about the whole crypto industry and though it's very promising but some people are just not sure if they want to commit their entire business into um the crypto space so I wanted to ask um personally what is is there anything ethereum is doing to solve that problem to help um people who are more interested in the crypto but are scared to jump into it because of what has been happening is anything that is being done in that site no I I think it's uh these are definitely really important problems and some of the barriers that the space has to cross if we want to like really get to some kind of greater mass adoption than what we have right now um I think the interesting thing about the FTX situation and the Luna situation is that they teach kind of kind of similar but Al but also somewhat um different lessons right so me like FTX is basically a case of a very centralized entity and yes that entity is part of the cryptocurrency space and it's operating with decentralized assets but it's a ultimately a very centralized thing controlled by a very small group of people it was even much more centralized than typical companies are right like typical companies often have different kinds of internal checks and balances to reduce the power of like one or a very small number a group of of people to do something wrong FTX did not even have that and the result it was a you know completely opaque Black Block system and that ended up um you know failing and breaking on people in the worst possible way right the um Luna had I think some element of that and there were definitely aspects of the Luna and Tera design that were like completely opaque but at the same time there like there wasn't a big aspect to it which just is that the Luna mechanism was bad right like not all defi mechanisms are good and defi is a set of tools and the like Financial engineering is a discipline and disciplines can be used to make good things and they can be used to make terrible things and they can be used to make things that break and they can be used to make things that look good for a while and then eventually break right like uh if you if you have access to a factory you can build a wheel that works but you can also build a wheel that you know seems like it works better for a short amount of time is four times cheaper but then after six months it completely breaks right so in the case of uh Lun know one of the lessons that I learned about defi is like simple def is good but complex defi is usually bad right there are examples of Def projects that have existed for a long time Unis swap maker you know all of the basic ones right they've existed for a long time so they've you they've handled billions of dollars of people's money and they have not broken um meanwhile Luna comes in handles people's money for about a year it goes all the way up to 34 billion and then it breaks and the way that it broke was like even like it was even something that like a bunch of people in the ethereum space expected right like if you look at the system and you look at the way that it promises 19% rates for example and I you know you just have a lot of experience just looking at andal with different like alith stable coin designs like you know what what are the ingredients that makes up an algorithmic stable coin that can last and you know what makes up one that looks like it lasts for some time but then breaks as soon as there's a bare market so like the reality is that just because something touches crypto like that that that doesn't by itself mean that it's good right and there's lots of ways to create things that touch crypto but actually do not inherit any of the advantages that you know blockchains or decentralized technology or mechanism design or all of these ideas are trying to bring right and like this is difficult because like crypto is this big marketing category but the problem with crypto as a marketing category is that like it's almost a natural tragedy of the commons right because crypto is like this category with no gatekeeping anything as long as it touches Bitcoin or ether or even Tron can call itself part of crypto and it kind of takes on know all of the Goodwill that the name has and so it's just you know it's kind of expected that lots of people are going to come in they're going to grab up the Goodwill use it to kind of you know create things that are completely unstable or just totally steal people's money until the name crypto basically has no Goodwill left right and I so I think it's like a combination of a technical problem and a com and a community self- policing problem and the technical problem is basically like let's make more like defi that is built to last right like let's make more things like maker Dow and fewer things that are like Luna or on the other hand let's build better social recovery wallets so or self- custody wallets in general so that people can more safely hold on to their funds by themselves so that people don't have to trust FTX or you know some other exchange to hold their funds for them right like these are technical problems and I think we can really improve on things from a technical point of view but the community self- policing problem is also an important one right like the the blockchains by themselves are neutral they're permissionless like ethereum is not going to censor Duke one right but and so at the same time the question is well you know what in the community is going to not let Duan in right like what in the community is going to actually very clearly Express the difference between projects that do make sense and uh projects that do not make sense and this is also a difficult problem and um often this problem happens because communities are not strong enough right so one example of this happening is that in many parts of the world what happens is that there are meetups but in a particular Town there's only one Meetup and this Meetup is run by a person and this person has a very hard time getting funded and what happens is that this person just because they have to get funded they end up accepting sponsorships from pretty much anyone like hey I'm Z zfx protocol and you know I'm just going to pay you $5,000 to run your meet up but just please let me present for a bit and then ZX protocol comes along and it talks about how it's going to give you 12% a month and a bunch of people listen and then six months later it blows up right um so like when there are good communities are lacking like often much worse communi is kind of step in and and take the rein and that's really something that needs to be avoided and I think I you know there are different ways of trying to solve this problem but the one weever that we a community definitely have access to is like actually you know being the good community and you know helping people that really have the right intentions but that don't necessarily have the right resources like actually step up and help each other right and uh that's something that I think uh the ethereum foundation has like done well in some contexts but definitely not done well in a lot of other contexts and that's something that I think is on you know both the ethereum foundation and on the you know everyone in the global crypto community that does have you know influence and resources and power um to um do their part to tr try to fix as soon and as well as possible thank you there's question right next to you yes please and then we'll come to that side hello uh my name is Ibrahim aam I own a company that does blockchain development called bitter bit based in Ghana here and we're working on lots of interesting blockchain projects uh one one project is about uh guaranteeing data Integrity on the blockchain um okay this is me and my question is why don't ethereum itself develop a decentralized exchange which would guarantee more trust by the ethereum holders and clients uh me myself I don't trust decent I don't trust centralized exchanges I only use centralized exchanges to cash out my money right then or buy crypto and that's it uh what I'm interested in especially in Ghana or Africa is uh bridging uh crypto into Mobile money in a decentralized way because currently how it's done you transfer to binance you sell your cryptos into Mobile money it's in your mobile money if you want to buy also mobile money um so if there if there's a way to communicate with MTN or Vodafone or these big companies to bridge directly decentralized way that would be awesome because this will guarantee Mass adoption and we will move away from centralized exchanges because this way you'll just transfer from your wallet and decentral way flips it into uh mobile money uh also this will be guarantee the next transition to the next phase which e-currencies like in Nigeria the Ina maybe in Ghana they're working on ecurrency too yeah yeah yeah no so the way that I think about this right is so first of all Unis swap exists right lots of people use Unis swab I personally used Unis swab literally multiple times just like in February like this month of this year so the question we want to ask is like if people are not using Unis swap or something like Unis swap what is the thing that it's not providing and I think there's a couple of answers one of the answers is that people are a lot of people are not comfortable enough with existing self custody options and like they and and so this is why they put their coins onto a centralized because like they trust that centralized exchange to do recovery for them right and to me the way that the decentralized ecosystem can compete with that is by creating these more decentralization native forms of uh you know backup and recovery and all of these things like social recovery and multi- wallets account abstraction and all these problems right and uh these are things that exist but they have to get much better from a Fe and ux point of view the second big reason is the reason that you mentioned right which is that people need exchanges to convert between the crypto ecosystem and local fiat currency ecosystems and the problem with that is that this is not something that the uh like this is not something that you can do entirely in the digital space right like the reason why uniswap can do these trades of like eth to um you know die or E to usdc or E to you know make or maker or whatever is because these are all erc20 assets that are defined inside ethereum and programs that are defined inside ethereum can read things that happen inside ethereum and they can do things and interact with other applications inside ethereum if we look at mobile money right like there is no built-in Gateway for in ethereum accounts to own mobile money units there's no built-in Gateway for an ethereum accounts to force a transfer of mobile money units there's no built-in Gateway for an ethereum a smart contract to verify that a mobile money payment has been made right and so for these reasons there is an unavoidable trust problem to some extent and the way that that see that that's been solved in kind of my impression of both Africa like like and some of the other attempts to do this kind of decentralized exchange just like in the 10 years of crypto's history in general is through escrow agents right so we all trust one guy and I send 0.01 eth to the guy then you um then you send $16 to me I verify that I receiv $16 and 0.01 get sent by the guy to you right there's a couple of problems with this one is that like there is still a bit of a trust problem because what if I send like I I claim that I send $16 but I never actually sent $16 and how do you in check and then right the other problem is that you have to trust the guy and you have this guy in the middle and what if the guy disappears for the second problem there is a natural smart contract solution right two of three escrow so instead of I send 0.01 eth to the guy you send $16 to me and I say yes and the guy sends 0.01 eth to you what happens is I send 0.01 eth to a multi two of three the three keys are me you and the guy then you send me $16 I confirm and by default just I confirm and you confirm and I release them the 0.01 e and you can have it only when the two of us have a disagreement the guy can do something but the only thing that the guy can do is send the 0.01 eth back to me or send the 0.01 eth to you the guy cannot steal the money by themselves right and this is like it's not perfect because there's still the risk that the guy colludes with me or colludes with you but it's a much lower risk and this is something that can be done and that can significantly reduce trust risk in escros and also by doing so make it possible for more people and people who have lower amounts of like existing reputation to become these escrow agents and make the and make this Market more competitive right and like if that's something that happens that that can already be an improvement for the second problem like what if you know I claimed that I received or I I received $60 I claimed that I didn't or maybe I never sent $16 but I sent that but I claim that I sent it in these cases they U like I think we have to rely on reputation systems and you know we have to rely on like the equivalent of credit scoring infrastructure of some kind and that's something that I think like blockchains and cryptography can potentially make better but like that is a difficult problem and you're not going to get to you're not going to quite get to a perfect solution right so like I personally would definitely highly encourage someone to try to create this kind of decentralized exchange and I think that's a project that I think a lot of people in the ethereum ecosystem would be very excited to support but it's uh it is an area where there are a lot of these very specific challenges and like you can't make a general purpose solution like the fact that you're interfacing with local um you know Financial systems the fact that you're interfacing with local forms of trust all of this means that you can't have this uh general purpose solution that works everywhere and so I think there's a lot of leg work that just unavoidable needs to be done by people on the ground to make something like this happen but like I really hope that something um that uh something does happen and I think I you know if it does then you know we should be supportive in ways that we can thank you we'll take one question from that side and then come back to you yeah I I'm liim I'm very interested in infrastructure in tooling I have a question a followup question on ZK technology um my question is um recently I've been reading a lot about ZK ZK EVMS uh through the LA zkc 2.0 and I want to know where are we now with ZK EVMS and what what um which element of ZK AVM should get us interested as developers building on Z avms that's my question yeah so ZK VMS are definitely very um very important and a very big deal right now um so the big projects in that space that I know about right one is the privacy and scaling Explorations team so bar the Barry hat teams Z AVM and this is one that scoll is collaborating with this is the one that Tao is collaborating with right um and the other one is polygon Hermes and which is what the polygon team with Jordy Bina is working on the third is there is a a ZK evm written in star's CYO language that is also a project um a fourth is zync which is not quite an evm it's more like ZK solidity but it's uh I think slowly moving in toward supporting more and more of the um like evm code um so all these projects exist and one of the ways to use them is to just use ZK rollups when they come out but if someone wants to um actively develop on them then uh like the thing that I would encourage is like obviously you have to just get acquainted with the Frameworks right so circom Cairo like all of these they all have their own tutorials and I um you know encourage people to do read the tutorials go through them through some exercises um in the case of Cairo Cairo also has you know excellent tutorials um of its own like try to build simpler applications and then kind of go you know work up from there and you know get to the point where like you can actually understand how some of these things work on the on the inside and contribute to them right so that's if you want to be a developer um and uh you know if if he wants to be a user of these platforms then either you're using um Z AVM just by using scroll or using Tao or using you know an evm implementation on starnet or you're using these ZK VMS by making your own um you know ZK rollup or ZK validum or one of these systems and in that case like obviously you would have to work with a technology a bit more closely um but even there like I think a lot of the kind of work at the beginning ends up being very similar right it's just kind of getting acquainted with with how these systems work in general um and then the other thing that often helps is like actually interacting with some of the teams and some of people the people working on these things in person right so uh you know the if uh you like you can find like get to a some one of a event in person like this is something that's happening more and more then like I think that's a good opportunity and like I personally you know definitely hope that more of them you know start happening Africa soon I think that's you know definitely one of the things that we can do that we can do more to encourage um but even if not in person you know like online there's a lot of opportunities there's a lot of these like active ways to learn by like not just learn by reading and Learn by participating and like that's uh something that I you know encourage people to do if they want to get into that space hello um recently you did talk about Ste um addresses um I would like to ask you why you think um it's necessary when it's kind of um trade trade off with um transparency I mean I think uh more like better forms of of privacy for regular users on the blockchain is something that just is important and needs to happen if we want to get widespread adoption right because I think a lot of people are not even realizing just the kinds of personal information that they're putting on chain at about their personal relationships their spending habits like all of their um activity that's happening on chain and if ethereum is going to become more mainstream then reducing the amount of info about just like each individual person that gets broadcasted to the entire world so that you know large corporations and pretty much anyone can do analysis on on it but you know like us as individuals probably can't is something that we are going to just have to do right like I think uh the the thing that we want to get closer to is this idea of like users controlling their own data and if they need to prove it to someone to Pro like to reveal data to someone to prove that they're trustworthy then they should have the tools to be able to do that but like that kind of revealing should you should not be revealing everything to the World by default right and so ways to improve transp privacy in a way that is practical possible for people to use works well with existing infrastructure and that is safe this is a difficult challenge but it's a challenge that a lot of people have been working on and like I think stealth addresses are like one part of the solution that can preserve privacy for a particular set of important use cases um just to gauge the room how many questions are still out there raise your hand really high if you have it just so that we can see okay I think there was a gentleman in the blue shirt back there who had one and we'll come back hi um so firstly thank you guys for working on ethereum I'm sure it's benefited most of us in this room um so my question especially to Jeff is what potential or implications do you think integrating artificial intelligence and blockchain technology has for Africa's Economic Development thank you this is a a very broad question but of course there's a lot of excitement around AI right now and a lot of things happening there um in the time that I've been in the blockchain space for 13 years um there's never been a time when I haven't seen someone talk about the connection between Ai and blockchain uh and there has never been a time when I have seen it come to somewhere useful that doesn't mean that it can't happen um I think that that uh when you put different kinds of Technology together uh if if you're very careful about thinking about the use case that you're addressing and making sure that that technology is the best way to meet your needs then amazing things can happen and just because I don't know that something will work doesn't mean it won't work um that's I don't know how most things work um but one of the reasons that I haven't seen a lot of existing work that successfully marries AI with blockchain is for two reasons one AI even when it becomes more accessible is still a relatively computationally intensive operation usually when we're doing things on blockchains and and we want to verify that something was done by a program for example if that program was an AI we have to produce some kind of proof for a long time we were producing those proofs directly and certainly you could not afford the gas to run an AI algorithm on chain we do have these new technologies like like xer knowledge techniques that allow you to prove uh a larger operation in a smaller number of of of computations but even with those those Technologies they're not at the point where they can Encompass these huge large language models and a lot of the things that we're currently seeing in AI uh that doesn't mean it won't happen in the future but so far it's not been very feasible to verify the output of these AI processes on chain so that knocks out a large class of of use cases where you might want to use an AI to make decisions or to have authority over something the second thing is that when you look at the AI technology itself um even when we have these really interesting applications that that really astonish us and and the ability of AIS to do things in natural language um the level of of uh integrity and control that we have over the specific operation of the mechanism is often limited and so if you look at putting a system like that in charge of a very technically complicated uh thing like a blockchain um there's a huge amount of things you have to think about to make that safe just want to say thank you all very much for coming for asking really deep and thoughtful questions um and happy to continue the conversation outside [Applause]",

    "title": "Effective altruism, blockchain, &amp; better ways to fund public goods | Vitalik Buterin (2019)",
    "content": "Robert Wiblin: Hi listeners, this is the \n80,000 Hours Podcast, where each week we   have an unusually in-depth conversation about \none of the world’s most pressing problems and   how you can use your career to solve it. I’m Rob \nWiblin, Director of Research at 80,000 Hours. People who follow me on social media \nwill know that I’ve been vocally   skeptical about the value of bitcoin \nand the blockchain more generally. But   it would be irrational to think I know \nwhere blockchain technology might go in   coming decades — many inventions take a \nwhile to find truly useful applications. And I’ve been very impressed with a \nhandful of people working to develop   what blockchains are capable of, \none of whom is Vitalik Buterin. I was first struck by his candidness and \ninsightfulness when I heard him on the   show Conversations with Tyler last year. \nVitalik is something of a child prodigy,   who’s been attracting a lot of attention \nthrough his research and accomplishments,   including creating the cryptocurrency Ethereum \nback in 2015 which made him incredibly rich. He’s been making impressive progress in both   engineering blockchain systems that \nmight be turned to useful purposes,   and as a theorist developing the so-called \ncryptoeconomics that explains how these systems   can be robust and why they might solve \nproblems that other technologies can’t. This conversation is quite related to my episode \nwith economist Glen Weyl from earlier this year   – episode 52, Prof Glen Weyl on uprooting \ncapitalism and democracy for a just society. Vitalik has actually co-authored a \nfew papers with Glen, and they’re   collaborators on the RadicalxChange project, \nthough they have plenty of disagreements as   well. So if you’ve already listened to that \nepisode, or want to go back to it first,   that’s great — but it shouldn’t be necessary to \nmake sense of what we’re talking about today. To most people it’s a bit confusing why I think \nthis topic of mechanisms for social coordination   is of such great importance. This interview also \nget pretty technical pretty fast, and don’t stop   to explain what things like blockchains, or \nquadratic voting, or stablecoins actually are.   So I’m going to start here by talking for a while \nuntil I think we’ve set the scene satisfactorily. If you’d rather skip that and go straight to the   interview with Vitalik, just \njump forward to minute 23. So for those who don’t know, the blockchain \nis a protocol developed about ten years ago,   which allows the maintenance of a decentralised \nledger, or a set of accounts that define who has   how much money on the network. Alternatively you \ncan transfer tokens that don’t have to look like   money per se — for example a token that indicates \nthat you own something in the real world. The first example of a blockchain \nwas called Bitcoin. In brief,   many computers around the \nworld run the bitcoin software. These computers build a long series of \naccounts, tracking the creation of bitcoins   and their transfer between different people on the \nnetwork, effectively making it a form of money. The technology is called a blockchain because what   you end up with is an enormous \nchain of blocks of transactions,   one after another. Each ten minutes or so the \nnetwork will add a new block of information that   encodes all the transactions that are going \non to the network from the last ten minutes. For a transaction to be added to a block, the \nowner of an account that has bitcoin in it,   needs to use cryptography to sign a message \nfrom that address, certifying that they want   to move bitcoin to another address. When a \nblock is created, all the computers on the   network certify that there are enough bitcoins \nat that address for them to be transferred. They all agree on what the block is following \npredefined rules, then move on to creating   the next block. For various reasons it’s \nimpractical to tamper with older blocks, so   once your transaction has been on the network for \na while, you can be confident it will stay there.   Everyone can see every transaction on the \nBitcoin network, though some later protocols   have made it possible to send other kinds of \ncryptocurrencies in a way that isn’t public. The computers running this Bitcoin or other \nblockchain software are doing so because they’re   participating in a competition to add blocks to \nthe chain. To get the right to add a block to the   chain, you need to solve a very difficult \nmath problem. Each time someone succeeds,   the network will create some new bitcoins \nto give them, paying them for their work. There’s a need to have a lot of \nprocessing power on the network,   dedicated to solving these math problems, \nbecause if someone could control more   than half of the processing power on the \nnetwork, they could in principle launch an   attack that would allow them to spend \nany bitcoins they own more than once. Having all this processing power there to make \nsuch an attack unviable, famously uses a lot   of electricity, which is one of the technical \nproblems that Vitalik has been working to fix. Bitcoin and other similar networks can process \n7 transactions between people each second. This   in principle allows people to buy and sell \ngoods, without having to trust a bank to   hold their money and make the transfer, \nor anything like that. So even if a bank   would refuse to help you buy drugs from a drug \ndealer, you could use Bitcoin to pay them, and   indeed illegal transactions like that have been \namong the most popular uses of Bitcoin so far. So it functions something like cash on the \ninternet. But it also has the weakness of   cash that if someone steals your cash out of \nyour wallet there’s nothing you can do. And   if you pay someone cash for something, then \nthey never send it to you, you’re screwed. Cryptocurrencies have famously had \nextremely unstable exchange rates   with the currencies we’re all used to using every \nday. Sometimes they’ll triple in value in a day,   or decline to a third of what they \nwere yesterday. This is pretty natural,   because their supply is completely invariant to \nhow much people are willing to pay for them. If   the demand to hold bitcoins goes up, no more \nbitcoins get made, so the price can fly up. It’s also natural because people \nhave no idea how much people will   want to use Bitcoins in future, and a \nlot of people are buying and selling   cryptocurrencies are speculating about \ntheir future prospects. But that has   made them a terrible way to store \na certain amount of value reliably. Some people are trying to create \nstablecoins — cryptocurrencies that   would have a fairly stable value in terms \nof USD or Euros or whatever. Of course,   it’s easy to devalue a cryptocurrency \nby just having the protocol set   to make more if the price rises too high. But \nwhat about preventing its value from falling?   That’s a lot harder. One way to do this \nis by holding lots of USD or other assets,   and standing ready to buy the stablecoin at that \nprice. But the ideal would be to make the price   stable without having to sit on one USD for every \nsuch coin. And pegging currencies like this, as   it is called, has a poor historical track record. \nMany countries have tried to make their currencies   have a particular value in another currency, \nand sooner or later seen their values crash. — OK, why might any of this matter? Vitalik \nand I talk about whether we can get the   blockchain to work to run currencies, \nbut to be honest that isn’t where I   see much upside. Most of us already have \naccess to acceptably stable currencies,   and the costs of sending money between people or \ncountries can be significant, but nothing crazy. The problems that I’m interested \nin are coordination problems as   a whole. The blockchain or other \nideas Vitalik is working to develop   might help humanity work together \nto solve the challenges we share. Many many problems can from \none point of view be seen as   coordination problems. This becomes \napparent if you study economics and   think about market failures in \ngoods that aren’t fully private. But it takes a particular view to see it. \nLet’s just run through a few examples. A first easy one is that most people would \nprefer to live in a world where others didn’t   suffer in horrible poverty, simply because \nthey dislike others having bad lives. If   their contributing a small amount of money \nmeant that everyone else did so as well,   and the problem would mostly be solved, then \nthey’d be happy to do so. Inasmuch as people   all around the world value extreme poverty being \neliminated, a donation you make to someone who’s   extremely poor, not only benefits them, but \nbenefits everyone else who cares about them. Within nations we have the structures that \nallow us to coordinate to solve this issue,   which is one reason that the welfare system \nexists. Many of us agree to contribute to the   redistribution of money to the poor, so long as \nothers then have to do so as well, through the   tax system. But no similarly powerful voting and \ncoordination mechanism exists at the international   level, which greatly reduces how much money gets \ntransferred from rich countries to poor countries. A second related example, is that many \npeople think that eating meat isn’t ideal,   and would like it for animals not to \nbe suffering terribly in agriculture.   A decent fraction would be happy to become \nvegetarian if meat substitutes were nearly as   tasty and cheap as meat is now. If 3 billion \npeople could get together and decide to all   become vegetarian simultaneously, you can bet \nthat with the massive incentives to do R&D,   we would very quickly invent meat and \nmeal substitutes that were that good. So the problem could be significantly \nsolved this way in a few years,   if not months. But there is no way for so many \npeople to get together and agree to do this,   so it doesn’t happen. And even if they did agree,   there’d be the incentive for each individual not \nto stick to the agreement once it had been made. So the problem of animal cruelty, which \ninitially seems like a very individual issue,   can also be seen as a collective action problem. Along similar lines, if we wanted to \nfund the R&D into green energy that   would strike a decisive blow in the fight \nto prevent catastrophic climate change,   it would probably cost less than $1,000 per person \nin the world to do that. Many many people would   be willing to contribute that sort of amount, \nin proportion to their wealth, if and only if   doing so meant that everyone else would pitch \nin as well, and the problem would therefore be   solved. But again, there’s no effective \nway to create or enforce such an agreement. The same is true of funding the fixed \ncosts of addressing many shared problems,   like preventing common diseases. Very often those \nfixed costs take the form of funding scientific   research to produce knowledge we all then share, \nbut it can also take the form of a piece of   infrastructure that only makes sense at a huge \nscale, like a sewer system for a big city. I mentioned climate change, but the \nsame applies to global catastrophic   risks more generally. It’s in everyone’s \ninterests to ensure that humanity doesn’t   suffer some terrible catastrophe \nthat ends up harming most of us,   whether that’s a nuclear war or an asteroid \nimpact or a terrible pandemic, or whatever else.   But for me as a selfish individual, it makes no \nsense for me to work to solve those problems just   to extend my own life expectancy. The benefit of \nmy work would go overwhelmingly to other people. Now of course governments to some extent \nsolve all the problems I’ve described above.   The US government as a whole overseas 5% of \nthe world’s population, so it has much more   willingness to spend money to prevent a global \ncatastrophe than any one individual. That’s why it   can spend billions identifying and tracking many \nof the asteroids and comets in our solar system. But there are serious problems here too, because \ngood collective decision-making is a collective   good that suffers the same underlying problem \nI’ve been describing. When each of us votes,   99.99999% of the impact that that vote \nhas is on other people in our country or   the world. The effect that the wisdom of our \nown votes has on us is basically nothing. So,   unlike when we’re buying a laptop for \nourselves, the selfish incentive to vote wisely   is mostly absent. This is a phenomenon \nknown as rational irrationality. Similarly, if you see the government doing \nsomething terrible that affects everyone in   the country a little bit, each person has almost \nno personal incentive to make a fuss about it. Along the same lines, I’ve discussed on \nthis show so many times how journalism   seems like a total dumpster fire. \nThe underlying reason is, again,   the coordination problem known \nas public goods provision. Each reader would be happy to pay a few \ndollars a month towards outstanding journalism,   if doing so meant that the country was \nwell informed and well run. The private   benefit they’d get from living in a more \nsane country would be easily worth it. I have a friend who pays $500 a year to get a \nsubscription to the Financial Times, which both of   us think is a very unusually thoughtful newspaper. \nBut he doesn’t read a word of it. He just funds it   because he thinks it’s very valuable for society \nas a whole for the Financial Times to exist. But he’s an unusual person. It’s very \nhard to get people to contribute much   to fund the creation of journalism. If I \nget a subscription to a good newspaper,   that doesn’t cause anyone else to do so. So \nI’ve paid all this money out of my own wallet,   but barely made a dent on how \nwell the country is governed. For sensible people who prefer reading fun stuff \nlike celebrity gossip, rather than learning about   tragic or annoying things that barely \naffect them, which should be most of us,   the existence of the Financial Times is a public \ngood much more than a private one. So even if   people could only get access to the articles by \nsubscribing, that wouldn’t solve the problem. So to sum up, here are just some things \nthat have major ‘public good’ aspects,   in the economic sense of the phrase \npublic good, which is to say that   people get the benefits of them, even if \nthey don’t contribute to creating them: The elimination of poverty\nNot hurting non-human animals  Most scientific research\nReducing the risks humanity faces as as whole  Producing information about what’s happening \nin the world and how to fix those problems  Making smart decisions collectively, whether \nas cities, or countries, or as a species  OK, so that’s a lot. Really, it’s \nalmost everything. If we could   eliminate 1% or 10% of the public \ngoods property of these problems,   that would make a meaningful difference, \nperhaps transforming the world in visible ways. To be clear, I don’t want to say that the \nframework of public and private goods is   the only way of conceptualising what’s \nallowing these problems to persist. But   I do think it is a powerful one \nthat can give us some insights. OK so that’s a big diversion into \nwhy when I see something that might   help solve coordination problems and \nprovide public goods I get very excited. What does that have to do \nwith today’s conversation? Vitalik Buterin and others involved \nin cryptocurrency economics, or the   RadicalxChange movement, have been thinking a \nlot about what new institutions or incentives   we could create that would make a dent on this \nproblem. Blockchain might provide new ways for   a group of people to set up those institutions, \nbut they’re interested in other options as well. An example of progress on this problem from the \npast is patents. We took what was mostly a public   good — breakthroughs in science and technology \n— and decided to give people an incentive to   invest in it and publish their discoveries, \nby making it a bit more of a private good,   by giving them a monopoly on their new insights \nfor some period of time. I think that mechanism   is overrated today and it has major problems, but \nit’s probably better than having nothing at all. One way to get people to contribute to a public \ngood might be to create a program that runs on   a blockchain, which says that if 1,000 people \neach commit $10 worth of a cryptocurrency to a   newspaper, it will get all that funding. \nBut if they don’t reach 1,000 people,   then it won’t and all of the people who \ncommitted will get their money back.   Kickstarter already works like this. But there’s \na serious free rider problem here — everyone   would rather that other people join that \ngroup of 1,000, so they didn’t have to. An advance on this idea that Vitalik has \nwritten about is quadratic funding. Basically,   let’s say you think it’s really useful \nfor society that newspaper X exist and   have money for its investigative journalism,   but you don’t particularly want \nto read that journalism yourself. With quadratic funding, you could put a small \namount of your personal money towards that   newspaper, say, $10. For mathematical reasons \nI’ll skip over here, we’d then take the square   root of your private contribution, add it to \nthe square root of everyone else’s private   contributions to the newspaper, and then \nsquare the total. The government, or another   funding source, would then match those private \ncontributions in some proportion to that figure. The crazy thing is that if the government \nactually gave exactly that full sum,   then each person would have the selfish incentive \nto personally contribute an amount that would   then collectively fund this public good at the \nright level to maximise the welfare of society   as a whole. Which is an amazing theoretical \nresult. There’s problems with that model,   but if the government just gave 1% \nof the resulting sum of square roots,   it could still represent a big step forward in \npublic good provision from where we are today. Now, if you had the right pool of matching \nfunding, and each individual had a unique   identity, then it could be fairly easy \nto operate a funding scheme like this on   a blockchain. Though you could do it \nusing non-blockchain technology too. This is one of many ideas \non the drawing board today   that might be transformative if \nwe could actually implement them. Another quite wild idea, if we mostly \nused blockchains to run our money,   and could get blockchains to know what was going \non in the real world, would be for countries to   commit huge sums of money to an escrow program \nwould only return the money to them if there   wasn’t a war between them. So, hypothetically \nthe US and China could stake $1 trillion   at the start of each year, which the blockchain \nprogram would only give back at the end of the   year if neither country killed a single soldier \nof the other country. Now there are probably   several fatal problems with this proposal, but \nmaybe there are other incentive structures like   this which we can imagine which could nudge \nstates towards cooperation and peace between,   which is probably a key determinant of whether \nthe future of humanity will go well or badly. That’s probably enough from me about why this \nissue matters so much. I’ll link to a great   and lengthy paper which goes into these issues \nin the show notes called Recent Developments   in Cryptography and Possible Long-Run \nConsequences if you’d like to learn more. I don’t like to talk this much at the start \nof the show, but some people who listened   to this interview thought without it \nit would be unclear why it matters. So without further ado, here’s Vitalik Buterin. Robert Wiblin: Thanks for \ncoming on the podcast, Vitalik. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. Thank you. Good to be here. Robert Wiblin: So, I hope to talk about your \nviews on long-termism, how to improve the world,   and how to better coordinate humanity \nas a whole. But first, what exactly   are you spending your time on at the moment and \nwhy do you think it’s really important work? Vitalik Buterin: Sure. So most people \nknow me as the Ethereum person,   and I do spend a lot of time working on Ethereum. Vitalik Buterin: The biggest thing in \nEthereum land right now is Ethereum 2.0,   which is this big multi-year long upgrade that \nwe’ve been working on to try to massively increase   blockchain’s scalability with sharding, and a \nmassive increase in security with proof-of-stake,   and to improve its programmability, change a \nwhole bunch of technical things that we probably   got wrong the first time. So, that’s been the \nbig thing that’s excited a lot of us for years,   but now it’s finally coming to fruition. \nThere’s these big teams around the world   that are working on – not just thinking about what \nthe protocols in Ethereum 2.0 should look like,   but actually implementing it. So, \nthe first phase of Ethereum 2.0,   which has the proof-of-stake, is going to \nprobably come out very early next year. Vitalik Buterin: There’s already some \ntest networks. They’re starting to link   different clients together and make \ndifferent implementations written by   different teams to talk to each other. \nA lot of really exciting stuff there. Vitalik Buterin: And yeah, and I think I’ve said \nit publicly a lot of times that I believe in the   potential of blockchain technology, but on \nthe other hand blockchains as they currently   exist are in many ways a joke, right? Like \n15 transactions per second… you’re not going   to run the world economy on top of that. \nAnd then the insanely gas-guzzling proof   of work that I’ve criticized many times as \nwell. So I’m definitely just really excited   about turning Ethereum into a system that \nwe can really fully be proud of and, and   expect it to push ahead and actually \nbecome useful for a lot more things. Robert Wiblin: Well, we’ll talk about some \nof those criticisms of blockchain technology   as it stands today in just a second. I \nguess it sounds like you’ve managed to   carve out time to actually continue working on \na lot of the technical sides of things and not   get kind of bogged down in the politics or \nperhaps the funding or bureaucratic aspect   of … I guess there’s organizations built \nup around Ethereum and blockchain now,   which I could imagine just absorbing \nall of your time and management. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. And in theory, having \nmore organizations is definitely interesting   and weird because … and first of all it’s \ndefinitely not like a conventional company,   like we don’t really have bosses that hand orders \nfrom the top-down to the entire structure. We   have teams, and teams have leaders, but the way \nthat the teams and the people inside of them,   their way of communicating with each other is this \nfairly unique thing that we’ve just had to learn   and figure out over the course of the last couple \nof years. And a big part of that does mean that   the teams that are working on the different parts \nof the protocols have a lot of autonomy to them,   which is also good for the people running \nthe Ethereum Foundation because it means less   work there. But I mean there is still a lot of \ntechnical coordinating work that needs to be done. Vitalik Buterin: And the other good news is \nthat I’m not the only one that doing it. So   we have a lot of wonderful people, \nlike Danny Ryan from the research   team deserves a huge amount of credit for \nthe work that he has been doing. Talking   to the different development teams and \ngetting them to coordinate together more. Crypto today\nRobert Wiblin: So I guess to   give some structure to the conversation today. \nI think first, first we’re going to talk about   kind of the blockchain and cryptotechnology as \nit stands today and how that’s working out. And   then we’ll move on to talking about potential \nfuture applications for blockchain technology   and how it could potentially end up having a big \npositive impact or perhaps not. And then we’ll   talk later on about long-termism and existential \nrisks and effective altruism and things like that. Robert Wiblin: So I guess for this interview, \nI’m in the slightly awkward position of being   a huge fan of you and your writing and all \nof your research. But I’m pretty skeptical   of blockchain technology, maybe relative \nto a lot of people who might interview you,   at least in terms of what it’s managed to \naccomplish so far. Though it sounds like   you’re perhaps even more skeptical of its \naccomplishments so far than what I thought. Robert Wiblin: But all of that said, I have \nno idea how useful it could turn out to be   in the future, which is one of the reasons \nI’m very keen to have this conversation,   to try to see whether it could potentially \naccomplish a lot more good going forward.   If I can start with a skeptical quote from \nthe cryptographic expert Bruce Schneier, who   I imagine you’re aware of, who \nwrite this in Wired in February. Robert Wiblin: “Do you need a public blockchain? \nThe answer is almost certainly no. A blockchain   probably doesn’t solve the security problems you \nthink it solves. The security problems it solves   are probably not the ones you have. Manipulating \naudit data is probably not your major security   risk. A false trust in blockchain can itself \nbe a security risk and the inefficiencies,   especially in scaling, are probably not worth it.” Robert Wiblin: “I’ve looked at \nmany blockchain applications   and all of them could achieve the same security \nproperties without using blockchain. Of course,   then they wouldn’t have the cool blockchain \nname though. Honestly, cryptocurrencies are   useless. They’re only used by speculators \nlooking for quick riches, people who don’t   like government-backed currencies, and criminals \nwho want a black market way to exchange money.” Robert Wiblin: So your collaborator, Glen \nWeyl, is also pretty skeptical of blockchains   as he mentioned when I interviewed him a couple \nof months ago. And you’ve been admirably candid   about what they can and can’t do so far. So to \nme, kind of like Bruce, it seems like so far   that the main application for blockchains has \nbeen to facilitate illegal activities like tax   evasion or avoidance of capital controls or \nselling drugs. Which may or may not be good,   but it’s not going to transform the economy. In \nterms of what it’s useful for now, what kind of   functions can it deliver for me that I can’t get \nsome other way through like saving my investments   in a bank account, or in equities, or transacting \nusing my credit card. Is there anything? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. I probably want \nto break my answer up into a few parts. Vitalik Buterin: So the first part is, \nwhat blockchains have done up to today,   which I would say is realistically \npretty much entirely cryptocurrency. Vitalik Buterin: Blockchains beyond cryptocurrency \nare themselves a big sector that I’m very excited   about. But being realistic, there has been \nvery little actual deployment of blockchain   applications outside of cryptocurrency so \nfar. And I do think that’s going to change   and it’s starting to change. For example, in \nSingapore there is this thing called OpenCerts,   which is basically using blockchains to \nverify that certificates like university   degrees haven’t been revoked yet. And they’ve \nmanaged to get partnerships with a lot of   universities and different institutional \nentities. So there’s things like that.   But now and in the past, cryptocurrency \nhas definitely had the biggest impact. Vitalik Buterin: And it’s definitely had both \ngood and bad consequences. On the bad side,   there’s obviously hacks and thefts and \nransomware and all the things that people   already talk about. And on the good side, \nI think people do underestimate the extent   to which it’s actually helped people by \nmaking it easier to move money around. Vitalik Buterin: For example, I visited Africa \ntwo months ago and there was this hackathon in   Cape Town and I talked to one of the local African \ncommunity members. This was a guy from Nigeria.   And I asked him, “What do people use blockchains \nfor today?” And his answer was actually pretty   simple. It’s just “There is a bunch of people here \nin Africa that are working remotely as software   developers or something else, for companies in \nfirst world countries and they need to have a way   to bring that money back to their homes so they \ncan feed their families and live where they are.” Vitalik Buterin: And the nice thing with \ncryptocurrency is that it’s actually a   lot cheaper than many traditional \nchannels, including things like   remittance companies. And sometimes people \ntry to measure this and they say, “Oh well,   these little quaint remittance companies are going \nnowhere, the sector is tiny”. But the nice thing   about cryptocurrency [inaudible 00:08:20] is that \nit’s about decentralization and you don’t need a   frigging remittance company to do remittance. You \njust take the money, turn the money into Bitcoin,   then sell the bit or ether or whatever, sell it \non a local exchange and you’re done. You have it. Vitalik Buterin: So it acts as this \nglobal layer that basically says,   instead of needing to have institutions that \noperate both in, say, North America and Africa,   you have one class of institutions that operates \nin North America, lets you convert money over   to cryptos. Then you have another class of \ninstitutions that operates over in Africa,   that acts as the local exchanges and \napparently the local exchange situation   is actually pretty good there. Then you sell \nthe cryptocurrency and you get the money. Vitalik Buterin: So there is definitely \ngenuine value in just pretty simple and   dumb things like that. And otherwise, you \ndefinitely correctly identified that kind   of censorship resistance flavored things are \nanother kind of category of usage that just   naturally is attracted to this sort of thing. \nBecause that’s a big property that the technology   has. And there’s downsides to that, but \nthen there’s also upsides to that as well.   And especially as we enter into this less \nfavorable geopolitical environment where   you’re going to have a lot of actors trying \nto restrict people’s ability to do things   with each other for reasons that have more \nto do with zero-sum competition than making   humanity better, trade wars and all that. So \nI definitely agree it’s a complicated issue. Vitalik Buterin: But the second part of this \nquestion is ‘blockchains in the future’. The   big thing that I think will make blockchains \nin the future more interesting is basically   if we managed to actually solve a lot of \nthe big problems that make them hard to   use today. Where scalability is probably \nthe big one, and because 15 transactions   a second is like basically nothing. And \nif you want to run global economies,   they need to go into the tens of thousands \nof transactions a second. And Ethereum 2.0   with sharding is hopefully going to let you do \nthat, which is nice and hopefully will provide   enough capacity that people can actually run \na lot of interesting things on top of it. Explanation of sharding Vitalik Buterin: Also, solutions to privacy. \nAnother thing is solutions to security. Vitalik Buterin: So, one of the negative \nconsequences of this is just all these   cryptocurrency thefts that keep on \nhappening. We’re like, “Another day,   another $34 million gone from an exchange.” And \nthe nice thing about that problem is that it’s   one of those problems that I also do think that \nwith better technology we can mitigate over time.   So with a lot of those things being \nimproved, I expect that, first of all,   a lot of these non-financial applications. \nLike as I mentioned, there’s a certificate   verification project which is quite interesting \nand promising. Just the stuff involving replacing   things like online identities and HTTPS \nand all of these things with more secure   and more decentralized alternatives. \nAnd blockchains are a big part of that. Vitalik Buterin: So, I guess the way that I \nview blockchains in non-financial contexts   technologically, is that with traditional \ncryptography you can prove to someone that   you did something. But with a blockchain, and \nnot with cryptography, you can prove to someone   that you did not do something or, so, you can \nprove to someone that you have some certificate   which did not get revoked. Or you can prove that, \nyou know, you did some computation that included   the outputs of everyone who submitted \nan input and you didn’t censor people. Vitalik Buterin: So one interesting application I \nwanted to highlight here is there’s … I published   this post on ethresear.ch, our research forum, \nwhere I had talked about the possibility of   using blockchains to do collusion-resistant \nmechanism design infrastructure. And we’ll   talk about what that means a bit later. But for \nnow think of it as just secure online voting. Vitalik Buterin: And online voting right now \nis like notoriously insecure for a bunch of   reasons. But, one of the reasons why is that \nit’s hard to secure because there’s all these   different requirements to it. And so I came up \nwith this design where you combined together   the properties of a blockchain, which basically \ngives you a kind of non-censorship guarantee and   says what the result is, you can prove that the \nresult actually is the result taking into account   everyone’s votes. And so the authority didn’t \njust decide not to include some people’s votes,   together with encryption for privacy, to \nget… and coercion-resistance, which has this   strong level of privacy that says you can’t \nprove to other people how you participated,   even if you want to. Which is really important \nfor voting to prevent things like vote selling. Vitalik Buterin: And together with zero-knowledge \nproofs which allow you to prove that the tallying   authority actually computed the results \ncorrectly despite all of the votes being   private. So you actually need to combine \nthese three components together and a   blockchain is one of them. And if you treat a \nblockchain as this cryptographic tool, then,   you can create these different kinds \nof systems and they potentially would   allow us to design these different gadgets that \nincorporate different kinds of mechanism design   into our lives in a way that’s hopefully \nactually secure and not going to break. Robert Wiblin: Okay. Let’s just back up a second. \nSo I guess me and maybe other listeners who know a   bit about blockchain, but not that much, might be \nfamiliar with a couple of issues that there are. Robert Wiblin: You mentioned the security problem, \nso that’s like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies   getting stolen a lot. Then there’s this issue \nof lots of electricity being used up in order to   secure the network, which I guess that’s because \nyou have like a proof-of-work method of securing   it and the hope is to move to a proof-of-stake \nwhich doesn’t require all the computation. Explanations of proof of work and proof of stake Robert Wiblin: And then there’s this \nissue of the kind of bottleneck on the,   on the number of transactions which you mentioned \nthat you’re hoping to solve with sharding,   which I guess is something like breaking up the \nblockchain into many different streams that each   can process that that number of transactions and \nthen they interact between one another sometimes.   How confident are you that each of those technical \nproblems can actually be solved? Are you sure that   ultimately we’ll come up with a technical \nsolution or is it still an open question? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, so proof-of-stake, very \nconfident. And so we actually had a spec freeze   of a phase zero of Ethereum 2.0 which is basically \nthe proof-of-stake part a couple of weeks ago.   The spec is theoretically frozen and the only \nthing that can change it is if people discover   security bugs. But the fundamental concept of \nproof-of-stake and the basic details of how   the design works is something that’s been \nthought about for years and we’ve figured   out everything that we could figure out in \ntheory and things have been fine. Now, then   there’s also proof-of-stake in practice and with \nproof-of-stake in practice, the main things that   worry me are basically just how the incentives \nin the protocol interact with the real world. Vitalik Buterin: So things like, for example,   are people just going to be lazy and run \nall their staking nodes on AWS? Are people   going to be lazier and just do all their \nstaking by sending their money to Binance,   and Binance are going to stake for everyone. Are \npeople going to stake in ways that are insecure   and lead to a bunch of people getting hacked \nat the same time? And how decentralized is it   actually going to be. Are things like ‘bribe \nattacks against validators’ realistic? All of   these different issues that have to do with the \nfiner points of how incentives defined in the   protocol interact with human motivations. \nThat’s probably the most uncertain thing. Vitalik Buterin: The good news is that some of the \nuncertainty is starting to be resolved already. So   we’re first in a proof-of-stake chain of the class \nof proof-of-stake that we’re doing to launch. So   Cosmos got launched a couple of months ago. And \nCosmos has these penalization slashing mechanisms,   they have rewards, they have all of these things \nand they’ve already been having some issues. Vitalik Buterin: And that’s been interesting \nbecause it both validates the concept and   the couple of times that they’ve had \nproblems, they even validated some of   our design decisions. So, and [inaudible \n00:17:01] we project wish them well and,   it’s been like we’ve learned quite a bit \nfrom that already. And of course when,   Ethereum 2.0 launches, we’re taking this kind \nof multi-pronged strategy where we first launch   proof-of-stake, then we let it run for \na bit, prove itself, then do sharding. Vitalik Buterin: I feel very confident about \nthese things in theory. But in practice, I’m not   expecting zero-to-one flavored kind of problems. \nI’m expecting one-to-n flavored problems, if you   know what I mean. Like just 15 different edge \ncases that we just have to think about, that all   leads to kind of small bugs that are fixable every \ntime, but then just do end up becoming problems. Vitalik Buterin: So in the case of starting \njust a peer-to-peer network that can handle   many megabytes a second passing through it \nand that ensures all the data reaches everyone   who needs it within a few seconds. There’s just \nthings that we’re doing that haven’t really been   done before. And also how that would interact with \npotentially powerful actors trying to attack it,   all of these different uncertainties. \nSo I definitely think that they exist,   but they’re more the sort of thing that we \njust have to cross when we get to it rather   than showstoppers and at this point I’m definitely \npretty confident that there aren’t showstoppers. Robert Wiblin: Do you want to comment \non the computer security or theft   issue? Whether you think we’ll be \nable to fix that one well enough? Vitalik Buterin: Sure. Yeah. So there is probably \nthree kind of sub-problems in computer security   and theft in the crypto space. One of them \nis people giving their money to central   authorities that screw it up. So like known \nbugs and getting hacked in all these other   exchanges. The second is people keeping money \nin their own wallets and that getting hacked.   And the third is putting their money into smart \ncontracts and those contracts getting hacked. Vitalik Buterin: So, for the first and… It \ndefinitely keeps being a concern. And the   idealist in me wishes centralized exchanges \nwould go away and we’d be able to entirely   decentralize the ones for everything except \njust interfacing with the banking system.   And there’s still the question of how close \nto that dream we can get reality to be. The   technology behind decentralized exchanges has \nimproved a huge amount over the last 12 months   and there’s even things like Uniswap running \nthat are fully decentralized but that have   even better UX than the centralized stuff. \nSo there’s reasons to be optimistic. Vitalik Buterin: But then I think cross-chain \nlike between Ethereum and other blockchains is   the one area that decentralized exchanges \nhaven’t really gotten a good handle on. So   technologically speaking, there’s been a lot of \nwork on trying to come up with these designs that   don’t require central exchanges to keep custody \nof a huge amount of money, which is good. But,   a second problem, which is if you have custody \nover coins, then what if your phone gets hacked,   your laptop gets hacked, you lose your \nfolios, your laptop and all of those things. Vitalik Buterin: So pretty much ever since \nI entered the space back in 2011 I’ve been a   huge enthusiast for multisig, which basically is, \ninstead of having one key that controls the coins,   the coins are basically controlled by a program \nand the program says “If two out of three keys   or three out of five keys sign a message, \nthen those coins to can be moved somewhere.” Vitalik Buterin: And sometimes you can even have \nmore complicated hybrid policies. For example,   the Ethereum Foundation wallet has a policy that \nsays that we have seven keys and if you want to   send less than 1000 ether a day, then one of \nthem is enough. But if you want to send more   than 1000 ether, then you need to get together \nfour of the seven. And that’s served us pretty   well. Basically I want multisig to get adopted \nby just everyone, individuals, organizations. But   then the problem is usability. For like who \nare your counterparties, what’s the format? Vitalik Buterin: So I’ve been an evangelist \nfor this thing called social key recovery,   which basically says that you have an account \nand you have one master key that can do things,   but then you also specify some set of other keys. \nAnd these other keys would generally just be like   your friends. And the idea is that any majority \nof those keys could come together and switch   your master key to something else. So if you \nlose your master key, they could recover it.   In case your master key gets stolen, then the \nidea is that you would store most of your money   in a savings wallet that would enforce like a \none day delay before you can take money out,   and so you’d get your friends together within the \nday so that they can switch the key and cancel it.   And it’s a security model that exists in the \nreal world already. For example, WeChat uses   it for account recovery. So I definitely want to \nsee more experimentation with social key recovery. Vitalik Buterin: And then first for the \nthird problem, which is smart contracts,   like formal verification, I’m obviously \nexcited about it, but then the other thing   is that we just have to be kind of humble \nand realistic about the kinds of things   that we can expect to be smart contract \ndefined. And we want fewer 5,000 line   contracts and more 50 line contracts. And \none of the reasons I’m a big fan of Uniswap   is that the design is so simple it basically \nis a 50 line contract. In practice it’s 200   but most of those are just convenience \noptions, like you can get away with 50. Robert Wiblin: So it sounds like if we managed \nto solve all of those problems that we’re still   pursuing the dream of cryptocurrency being a \nmedium of exchange where people might engage   in lots of everyday transactions using \ncryptocurrency. Which so far has been   something that has been … People are using it \nfor remittances and cases where it’s transacting   between people where the banking systems aren’t \nvery well integrated or people are kind of   unbanked. But I guess if you can solve all these \nproblems then it might be possible for someone   like me to actually want to use cryptocurrency \nto buy things on a day-to-day basis. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. And I definitely think \nthe quality of blockchain technology can get   there. And not just cryptocurrency, also \nnon-financial things. So you’d own things,   like self-sovereign identities. So basically \nhaving something that you can use to sign   in to just regular web services that \ndoesn’t depend on Google or Facebook. Robert Wiblin: So why do you think people \nlike Schneier are so vitriolically negative?   Do think they just aren’t quite \nseeing like the technical advances   that you think are likely to come eventually? Vitalik Buterin: I think first of all it’s \nimportant for us to address that they have valid   points like proof-of-work sucks, blockchains \nas they currently exist are unscalable,   a bunch of the security issues haven’t been \nsolved. So it’s important to be honest about   those things. But it’s definitely, \nI think, also the case that a lot of   the people who are kind of famously bearish on \nblockchains aren’t following the space as it’s   going to be in five years and all the newer \ndevelopments that have been happening there. Vitalik Buterin: And I think there really are \na lot of things coming down the pipeline that   really can solve a lot of the problems, definitely \nnot literally all the problems. Like having users   protect their own money in their own accounts \nisn’t going to solve ransomware for example,   but if we can at least start with \nthe problems we can solve easily.   If we can at least start with using crypto \nblockchain technology itself to deal with   things like user account and exchange \ntheft, then that’s a pretty big start   already. And for the other things, I’m \nsure they can figure it out over time. Robert Wiblin: Are there any problems \nor applications for cryptocurrencies or   blockchain technology that people talk about \nwhich you think are bad applications of it,   where it’s not the right solution? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, and there’s \ndefinitely a lot of things. Vitalik Buterin: First of all, there \nare these applications that just say,   let me put these entire really big files \nin like 2.6MB PDFs on the blockchain and   I think even with sharding, that’s just going \nto be crazy expensive and not very pointful,   especially when you can just like \nstick the hash of the file instead. Vitalik Buterin: Also things like using \nblockchains to just store messages that   don’t have any kind of value components to them. \nThey just don’t really need this property of being   verified by a large number of computers \nat the same time. There’s a lot of people   that just use blockchains either \njust inefficiently or way more   than they need to. So there’s \ndefinitely quite a lot of that. Vitalik Buterin: I mean there’s blockchain \napplications that people do that I think are   stupid regardless of whether or not they’re \non the blockchain. And even just the ideas   behind the large portion of ICOs right now \njust don’t make any sense at all. So there’s   definitely a lot of things that I can \nargue against and often pretty publicly. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Some applications that \nI’ve heard that seems strange to me … Well,   voting where it seems like pen and \npaper, at least for like national   elections is a lot more trustworthy than \nanything on computers, at least for me. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. As I mentioned, like you \ncan use blockchains to make voting kind of better,   but like you have to really think hard about how \nyou’re doing it and if you’re just rolling votes   on chain, that’s like counterproductive. Like if \nyou do that then someone can make a smart contract   that says if you vote for the Purple Party, I’ll \ngive you a 0.01 ether and you’re just going to   get a bunch of votes for the Purple Party, \nand guess who’s running America in 2020, so- Robert Wiblin: Yeah, I guess people \nhave talked about it as using it as   like auditing supply chains to make sure that \nproducts came from particular places. Which   just seemed like it was solving the wrong \nproblem with that one where it’s like the   issue is like fraud along the line where people \ncould just put lies in the blockchain, right? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. So this is one \nexample of a problem that people sometimes   think blockchains solve, but really they don’t \nsolve, which is an Oracle problem. People often   have this background impression that blockchains \nare this technology that provides trust. And   the reality is that they provide a specific \nkind of trust for a specific kind of claims. Vitalik Buterin: And a blockchain has no idea \nwhether the temperature in Toronto is 10 degrees   or 20 degrees or 80,000 degrees. It has no \nidea whether the thing you just shipped me   in the mail is a real phone or a fake phone or \na real phone that’s secondhand and is going to   break in two months. A blockchain has no idea \nwhat the price of real world currencies are,   and so on and so forth, and there’s this big long \nlist. And so a lot of blockchain applications   basically do require either combining together \nblockchains with other data sources and you using   a blockchain more as this kind of place where the \ndifferent things get put together and organized   or sometimes the data is just so subjective \nthat like it doesn’t really make sense at all. Vitalik Buterin: Like for fire insurance \nfor example, like what are you going to do   there? The problem is evaluating what \nthe level of damages require. That’s   like incredibly subjective and there’s no \nway a smart contracts is going to help. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, and another application \nthat seemed odd to me was people talking about   using the blockchain to kind of get more autonomy \nover the kind of data that online services like   Facebook and other websites hold about you. I \ndon’t understand how it would function as kind   of a data storage system because it seems like \nanything you put on there is getting duplicated   so many times that the cost becomes enormous. Is \nthere something that I’m totally missing there? Vitalik Buterin: There is a version \nof that which actually makes sense,   and the version of that which makes \nsense is that you have services where   the data is kept client-side by default, \nbut then like people have tested the data   and there’s zero-knowledge proofs over the \ndata. And then if you want to sell the data,   you can use cryptographic protocols that basically \nsay “I’ll give you the data,” or “I’ll let you   compute one particular function over the data \nif you pay me some number of points.” And then   for that to work like you can piece together like \ncryptocurrencies and blockchain hash commitments   in zero-knowledge multiparty computation. \nBut for something like that to work, that’s   a pretty serious challenge. You’re not just going \nto shop patches of stuff on the chain and sell it. Robert Wiblin: Don’t those zero-knowledge   proofs require a lot of computation \npower or have I misunderstood that? Vitalik Buterin: They do and that’s definitely \none of the biggest kind of downsides of them   right now. But one of the really nice side \neffects that blockchains have is that they   are leading to a huge amounts of money being \npumped into making these zero-knowledge proof   protocols work better. And so back in 2013 \nthere were a couple of academics working   on these things in the shadows, but now you \nhave like 20 different protocols and there is   dozens of engineers trying to figure out how \nto cut the proving times down. In some cases,   working on using ASX to cut proving \ntime down, trying to cut down the   size of the proofs and verification times. So \nthere’s definitely a lot of work being done   there that can make things possible in a few \nyears that weren’t possible a few years ago. Robert Wiblin: What do you think are the most   widely held but incorrect beliefs \nin the crypto community as a whole? Vitalik Buterin: Oh, that’s interesting. \nThe crypto community isn’t really a unified   thing and there’s definitely kind of different \nsub-tribes inside of the crypto community. And   I think different sub-tribes have different \nmisconceptions. Like on the Bitcoin side for   example, like this idea that 2% inflation is \nthis thing that’s wrecking the economy and the   next… And the next big step for progress would be \nturning humanity into a type one civilization that   roams the stars is to get rid of existing fiat \ncurrencies and replace them with this 21 million   fixed supply kind of thing. I think that’s crazy. \nOn the side of things like EOS and Tron and these   more kind of semi-centralized projects. I think \nthey have this belief that basically says like,   “Oh these blockchains are not super decentralized \nanyway and so we’re just going to be even more   centralized and so we’re going to get more \nefficiency without getting any of the downsides.” Vitalik Buterin: But I think they \ndon’t really realize the kind of,   some of the more subtle benefits that \nde-centralization gets you and a lot   of those things are going to come out like if \npolitical environments become less favorable. And   on the side of things like people trying to use \nblockchains or … Well it depends on the use case,   right? But like if it’s immense then, there \nis just the fact that like number one existing   payment systems work in a lot of contexts but \nexisting payments systems also don’t work well   in a lot of contexts and kind of seeing both \nsides of that is… I see a lot of people kind   of making a mistake one way or the other where \nthey think that either cryptocurrencies are   going to completely overtake Venmo or they \nthink that there is no room for them at all. Vitalik Buterin: Oh, here’s an interesting \none actually. I think a lot of people in   the censorship resistance space in general, so \nlike both people in the blockchain space that   care about censorship resistance as a topic and \npeople outside of it, they tend to kind of not   have very good models of politics. Basically, \na lot of people have this mindset that says,   “We’re going to create this thing, and it’s \ngoing to just on its own completely be able   to overpower governments and they’re not \ngoing to be able to do anything about it   and it’s just going to turn the world into \na crypto-anarchy and that’ll be great.” Vitalik Buterin: And I think \nthey underestimate the power   that governments do have. So you look \nat things like uh, the great fire wall,   like different countries attempts at \nenforcing copyright infringements on   the Internet. Crackdowns on the sex industry — \na lot of these different kinds of censorship. Vitalik Buterin: They, there are \nmany cases in which governments try   much less hard than they could if they \nreally wanted to. And so, you know,   you have these restrictions, then you have people \nusing technology to get around these restrictions.   But then you have counter measures against those \ntechnologies. And then you have counter measures   against the counter measures, but the parties \non both sides and particularly on the government   side are limited by much more than technological \nconstraints, right? They’re also limited by their   populations opinions on basically whether or \nthese restrictions are just. They’re limited   by enforcement costs. They’re limited by social \ncosts. Schelling fences. Like if we allow this,   would that lead to allowing this other thing, \ncan we ban this without risking banning other   things? All of these different complexities. And \nif you’re building censorship resistance software,   then you’re not just playing this kind of \ngreat battle of technology versus a state here. Vitalik Buterin: You’re also really \ninteracting with these complicated   political equilibrium and what does that mean? \nWell the answers to those questions are really,   really complicated and specific. It’s not \nany sort of single answer. It’s a category   of questions that I think you could get some \ngood answers out of if you think more about it. Robert Wiblin: Do you think it’s possible in \nprinciple to create a pegged stable coin that’s   not actually backed one-for-one by the asset \nthat it’s meant to be tethered to? I guess   from both from a technical logical standpoint \nbut maybe also from an economics standpoint. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, and makerdao is definitely \ntrying and I think it’s not possible to make one   with a risk of zero, but I think it’s possible \nto make one with a risk that’s low enough,   but then the problem is that if you \nneed one with a risk that’s low enough,   then you have these capital inefficiencies, \nright? Basically it needs to have a double or   triple collateralized with Ether or with other \ncryptocurrencies. And then, there is some of the   problem of how secure is it actually? And the \nproblem is that because the whole risk model is   about tail risks. You don’t really know. \nYeah. And it gets really complicated and   a lot of people I think can measure this sort of \nincorrectly. They say things like, “Oh, the price   of Dai went down to 0.92 for like 20 minutes \ntoday, that means the thing is not stable.” Vitalik Buterin: But no, that’s exactly \nthe wrong thing to measure. Right?   Things that stay at exactly $1 almost \nalways until one day they don’t are   like exactly the sort of fake stability \nthat Nassim Taleb likes to criticize. So   the thing that you’re trying to optimize for \nisn’t a lack of fine day-to-day movements,   it’s minimizing the probability that the \nthing just suddenly one day does something   catastrophic and yeah, I mean the problem is \nthat it gets hard to estimate the probability   of catastrophic things. And I definitely think \nthat cryptocurrency is interesting because it   does create this environment where like you can \nprofit from attacking one of these things then you   can and someone will. And so far it’s definitely \nlooking kind of very soft-promising but we’ll see. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. So the basic problem there \nis that kind of the less collateral you have,   then the more you’re at risk of someone \nprompting, trying to do a run on the   currency and breaking the peg. Whereas, \nbut then the more capital you have to have,   the more expensive it is to establish a thing \nand then like, what’s the business model here?   Is that basically it? Yeah. Do you think \nthere’s ever going to be a way to kind of   reduce the bad illegal uses of cryptocurrency \nwithout preventing the good uses other than   like traditional law enforcement, or \nis that just not gonna be possible? Vitalik Buterin: As I mentioned, I think there \nare a few specific categories of bad uses that   you can prevent because people have the incentive \nto prevent it, which is basically like stolen   funds. And I mean stolen funds definitely \nhave a lot of kind bad knock-on effects. Vitalik Buterin: So for example, you \nhave the North Korean government,   and there’s people claiming that the \nNorth Korean government is figuring   out how to steal crypto and those funds \nare potentially being used to fund their   nuclear program or other unsavory things \nand, if they didn’t have those funds,   then some of those unsavory programs could end \nup proceeding more slowly, or not proceeding. Vitalik Buterin: And so if you can solve the \nproblem with theft in general, then you can also   reduce the problems that come with criminal \norganizations having more money. So there’s   some things that you can do. There’s probably \nother things that you just can’t do basically,   except by kind of increasing surveillance on \nsomething other than the blockchain system itself. Vitalik Buterin: So one example of this, right \nis that people sometimes say that … Both the   proponents and detractors sometimes say, “Oh, \ncryptocurrency is going to lead to making it   impossible to collect taxes.” And I think that’s \ncrazy because people get caught for cheating on   their taxes in a bunch of different ways all \nthe time, right? Like if you’re a millionaire,   then you sometimes get caught because \nyou registered an income of $23,000,   but you have two big swimming pools in \nyour backyard. So things like that. Another   example is that you could even potentially use \ncrypto technology to help make tax-enforcement   systems that are better. So for example, use \nyour knowledge groups to collect sales taxes   without the government having to have knowledge \nof every single transaction and things like that.   There’s things that that you can do there. \nYeah. And so like basically I think in some   cases the answer’s definitely yes, there \nis a bunch of different ways to mitigate   it and in so me cases, there is definitely \nkind of things that just genuinely can’t be. Robert Wiblin: Why do you think we don’t \nsee kind of more of a crypto-driven crime   wave? I remember back in 2013-2014, I \nwas kind of worried that like Bitcoin   could potentially be used to create kind \nof markets for assassinations or like other   illegal behavior. But it seems like that \nbasically hasn’t happened at all. Do you   have a theory for that or they could otherwise \nkind of help organize criminal organizations? Vitalik Buterin: Sure. And I have a couple \nof theories. So one of them is that I think   people underestimate the difficulty of \nsuccessfully running a kind of, anonymous,   kind of Tim May cypherpunk style illegal \norganization and like, because these days,   you can get de-anonymized in so many ways from \nthe time zones that you log on and make posts,   from like text analysis based off of what you \nwrite, from just the ways that you make orders   for servers, the ways that you log into the \ninternet. So like people just make a lot of   these mistakes and so it’s really difficult to \navoid all of them. Even if you’re a technically   skilled person, you can try. Like if that sort \nof thing became something I was interested in,   then I would probably resort to crazy tricks \nlike writing all of my forum posts in French   and then shoving them through Google Translate \nto just throw off the text analyzers. But it’s- Robert Wiblin: It’s really hard to stay \nanonymous. So it’s hard to patch every hole. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I mean it’s really \nhard. And the interesting thing is that   there’s also kind of diseconomies of scale. If \nyou want to add up a scale of five to 10 people,   you generally can and you could get away with it \nbecause these law enforcement bodies, as scary   as they seem, are often quite under-resourced. \nBut then if you go up to 100 thousand people,   then eventually you get figured out. So I \nthink there’s that. And also I think people   underestimate the extent to which the online \nsoftware industry in general kind of relies on   just goodwill and people being willing to kind of \nvolunteer their time out of passion. And so there   just aren’t enough technically skilled people \nin the world that are like interested in writing   the software to make assassination markets \nwork really well. Right? So that’s one thing. Vitalik Buterin: And then another thing \nis that if you want to make it work well,   then you need collaboration between different \npeople, and collaboration between people rests   on this assumption of a kind of honesty and \ngoodwill and if you’re talking about people   that are already willing to make assassination \nmarkets, are they already going to have that?   Criminal coordination is definitely kind \nof harder than it seems and a lot of the   successful criminal coordination kind of rests \nupon existing structures of coordination things   like families or these Mafia organizations \nthat have existed in “meatspace” for a long   time and like … And coming up with a new \none of those on the internet is not exactly   trivial. So yeah, and basically I think \nanonymous internet technology, it doesn’t   solve a lot of the key problems that someone \ntrying to make that kind of anonymous internet   enterprise that wants to evade everyone \nthat are trying to go after it would have. Crypto in the future\nRobert Wiblin: All right, let’s move on from kind   of crypto and the blockchain today and kind of how \nit stands onto thinking about how much better it   might be in the future and the problems that it \nmight be able to solve. So you and Glen Weyl, and   others involved in this radical exchange project \nhave been … Yeah, thinking about how blockchain   technologies could be kind of used to give people \nthe right incentives to solve problems like   collective action problems that humanity faces and \nin a way that existing institutions are failing   to do. And I guess that includes a public goods \nprovision or avoiding the tragedy of the commons.   For example there’s that liberal radicalism idea \nthat Glen and I discussed, which is kind of an   attempt to give people reasons to contribute \ntheir resources to providing public goods. Robert Wiblin: I hope our listeners will forgive \nthis one quote, but I think it kind of helps to   motivate the whole discussion we’re having \nhere and it’s from an unpublished paper on   possible uses of cryptographic advances \nthat I hope we’ll be able to link to when   the episode comes out and under the heading \n“disorganized shared interest groups” it says,   “It’s generally the case within any given \npolitical system that only a very small portion   of groups with common interests successfully \norganized to pursue those interests. For example,   private industries are often organized to \nlobby the government, but the consumers of   these industries’ products do not. Influential \nGrassroots movements have arisen around some   issues like abortion and police violence, but not \nothers of comparable concern like economic policy,   the collection of people who would be happy to \nbecome vegetarian if it meant everyone else did,   or to pay for news if it also meant \neveryone else did and so on is large. Robert Wiblin: But people do not form robust \norganizations into such packs. And similarly   even the voters as a whole would have clear common \ninterest in coordinating to become more informed.   The possibility of such a widespread agreement \narising seems wholly implausible and these kinds   of problems seem very widespread. So groups \ninterested in funding lobbying efforts could   use smart contracts that result in their making \ndonations only if enough other people do as well.   And perhaps scaling down the donation size as the \nnumber of people who commit grows.” So I guess   I just want to start by opening… By asking you \na very open question, which is perhaps kind of   the main topic that I want to discuss today, \nwhich is what incentive design mechanisms or   kind of smart contracts or distributed autonomous \norganizations are you most excited about whether   they’re blockchain related or not and kind of \nhow could they make a difference to the world? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, sure. I think like \nfirst of all, the whole kind of decentralized   autonomous organization thing is interesting, \nbut also there is a limit to it that we didn’t   I think quite realize and appreciate at the \nbeginning. So the kind of challenge there right,   is that at the end of the day all it \nis is people putting money into a pool   and then using some pre-agreed rules to \ndistribute the money in the pool around. Vitalik Buterin: The problem we can solve, like \nfor example, is giving people incentives to put   money into the pool. Right? And so like you \nhave something like MolochDAO for example,   which has a few dozen people putting money into a \npool, so sending money to Ethereum public goods,   but the amount of money that’s in the thing is \nfairly small and most of the money that is there   comes from rich people, which an economic theory \nwould predict are kind of the ones that are,   at least from a selfish point of view are more \nnaturally inclined to be willing to send their   money into these kinds of things because they \nbenefit from a larger share of the benefit. Vitalik Buterin: It’s not solving a lot \nof the fundamental public good problems   that we would ideally want to solve. So \nthat’s one challenge. Another challenge is   this whole kind of collusion-resistance \nissue, right? Which is basically that,   one of the main benefits of a blockchain, is \nthat everything that happens on a blockchain   is public. It’s publicly visible. And even if \nyou have zero knowledge encrypted for privacy,   these kind of traceable records and receipts that \nyou can audit and use to prove what happened. But   the problem is that if you analyze a lot of \nthe mechanisms that we use in the real world,   many of them like really crucially rely on an \nassumption that people are not colluding with   each other and that if a person takes \nan action, the only consequence of that   action is the consequence that’s kind of \ndefined inside of the mechanism, right? Vitalik Buterin: So if you go into an election \nand you go make a vote for Andrew Yang,   then like the only consequence of that is \nthat it slightly increases the probability   that Andrew Yang is going to win. And that’s \nsomething which affects everyone in the country,   and like ultimately in the world, right? Like \nthere’s no kind of specific benefit that you   get from it. But if you start having votes on a \nblockchain, then other people can see, “Oh hey,   you voted for this guy.” Then people can make \nsmart contracts that say, “Oh you voted for   this guy and I’m gonna give you a set amount \nof money”. Or that, “Oh, you voted for this   guy and I’m going to penalize you”, or, \n“I’m not going to sell things to you.” Vitalik Buterin: And so the problem with a \nlot of these DAO constructions is that they   run into these kind of twin problems, where \none of them is plutocracy which is that only   the rich people really have an incentive to \nparticipate. And the second is collusion,   which is basically that really if these things do \nbecome sources of substantial economic power, then   people are going to try to use these techniques \nto manipulate each other into voting in particular   ways. And we’ve seen both of those examples. \nSo in a lot the coin votes that we’ve had in   Ethereum it’s been the case that just one guy had \nover 20% of the entire share of the votes, meaning   in EOS, there was a lot of interesting evidence \nof collusion happening. And in the case of EOS,   well what happened was that there was this \nkind of collection of pools like seemingly   based in China, some in other places that \nhad convinced each other that just that,   “I vote for you, you vote for me”, or \n“I pay you money and you vote for me   so I can become a validator and I \ncan give you some of that money.” Vitalik Buterin: And all these different \nthings that just basically fundamentally   disagree with the usual economic model. Right? \nLike the extent to which economists implicitly   assume noncollusion is pretty severe. If you \njust open up any, most game theory textbooks,   they just … People often think of it as \nthe worst thing that these things assume   is perfect information and perfect rationality \nbut like really no. You also make this weird   assumption that like everyone is making decisions \nindependently. There aren’t groups of people that   are thinking about each other’s incentives. \nThere aren’t people pooling each other to make   decisions and so even something a second price \nauction for example, there’s all these famous   mathematical proofs about how optimal it is, but \nin reality if the top bid or the second highest   bid are colluding, they can work together to push \ndown the price and it’s not efficient anymore. Vitalik Buterin: So trying to figure these… \nBasically, once the possibility of collusion   enters the picture, then just a lot of things \nbreak and the space of mechanisms that you have   to work with ends up like really decreasing \nby a huge amount. So this is where the work   that I have been, that I mentioned earlier on \ncollusion-resistant mechanism design really comes   down, right? You can think of it in its simplest \nform as being just an online voting system. But   really it doesn’t have to be a vote, right? It \ncan just be, select any function like F of a   bunch of votes, and let everyone provide their \ninputs and then compute the output and provide   the output. And you do this computation in such \na way that nobody learns what the actual inputs   were and nobody has the ability to prove what \ntheir inputs were. And if you do things that way,   then you actually can kind of instantiate \nin reality this game theoretic ideal. Vitalik Buterin: That says that people are \nmaking decisions independently that a lot   of these systems rely on. And so we can start \nactually doing things like quadratic voting,   quadratic funding, and all of these really \nwonderful things that at larger scales. Explanation of quadratic voting Vitalik Buterin: It’s not going to \nsolve all problems. But I definitely   think something like it is necessary \nto kind of prevent those schemes from   completely breaking. Right? Another example \nof collusion actually, this is a fun one. Vitalik Buterin: So quadratic funding, \nwhich is also called Liberal Radicalism,   this mechanism proposed by Glen Weyl for funding   public goods. And the basic principles here \nis that you have projects and each of these   projects represent some public good and people \nhave the ability to donate money to projects. Vitalik Buterin: And if multiple people \ndonate money to a project, then there is   this central pool of money which basically adds \na subsidy to the donation to kind of take into   account the facts that each of those people are \ncontributing money to something that benefits   all of them together. And the more people donate, \nthe more the subsidy grows, kind of quadratically. Vitalik Buterin: And so we have this thing \ncalled the Gitcoin CLR which is basically trying   to do that at a small scale for public goods \nwithin the Ethereum ecosystem. And right now   the matching pool is about $50,000 every couple \nof months. And the problem that it had was that   there were a couple of cases where there were \njust accounts that were kind of clearly either   not legitimate accounts and like big accounts, \nor in some cases were kind of related accounts   that were voting for the same thing. The \nbiggest example of this was that there was   a bunch of accounts that were all employees \nof the same company that basically donated   to the company and lots of the CLR matching. I \nthink like these kinds of exploits, and they’re   definitely going to happen to some extent, but \nthere’s things that you can do to mitigate them. Vitalik Buterin: One example of a thing you can \ndo to mitigate it is, you just encourage more   kind of honest participation. So the problem \nwith the Gitcoin CLR is that there are only a   few dozen people participating. But then if you \nincrease that to a few thousand people , then a   company with 10 employees is not going to be able \nto extract subsidies to the same extent. Another   thing you can do is again have the collusion \nresistance. A third thing you can do is you   can try to change the formulas to try to be more, \nkind of robust against medium levels of collusion   that actually exist. So I wrote a research post \non this. I forget the name, but if you just search   like quadratic funding under my name, you can \nprobably find it. And that’s definitely been like   interesting to kind of just see in real life like \nhow this market for public goods works and what it   does well and how it sometimes doesn’t work and \nfrom there you keep going in and improving yet. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. So we kind of \njumped to the problems right away. But,   I guess for listeners who aren’t so familiar, is \nit possible to kind of paint a picture of how,   in a good future kind of the work that \nyou’re doing on incentive design? Yeah.   Mechanism design, incentive design \nand these automated smart contracts,   or automated processes on the blockchain, how they \ncould help and what problems that could solve? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. So I guess the big \nproblem that quadratic funding is solving is   this public goods problem, which is that like \nthere is just so many different projects and   like things that all of us rely on, where they’re \nnot a thing that one person does specifically for   another person. There are thing that a person \ndoes and what the thing that the person does   benefits a huge number of people. And that \nperson really has no fine-grained control   over which specific people it benefits. And \nso, one example of this would be open source   software. Another example might be even just \nall of the blogs and public things that I’ve   provided in this podcast. In the kind of \nless info and more physical world context,   like public parks and roads. And sometimes you \ncan charge for roads but sometimes you can’t. Vitalik Buterin: So yeah, I mean there’s \nlike just so many things in the world that   just don’t come in this kind of convenient \nformat where it’s one person doing a thing   for another specific person and so you can \nhave a nice efficient market where they’re   selling it to each other. We just don’t have \ngood institutions for kind of encouraging the   production of these kinds of things. And so, I \nmean basically what we have right now is either   governments or large corporations or whoever \nbids. And that’s basically all and it’s good   that we have each of those and they actually \nprovide those things. Because if they didn’t,   then there’s no way we’d have a civilization. \nBut at the same time, there’s a lot of things   that they leave undesired, right? These \nmechanisms just like don’t do a good job   of kind of incorporating all of the information, \nthe kind of highly distributed information that   we have in the world about what it is that \nis useful and that people find valuable. Vitalik Buterin: So quadratic funding is basically \ntrying to make a sort of more market like   alternative that encourages the production \nof public goods that basically says like,   we’re going to be neutral, we’re not going to have \nour own kind of specific opinion about what is a   real public good and what isn’t. We’re just going \nto say, people can donate money and stuff. And   if a lots of people are donating money to the \nsame thing, then that’s clearly a project that   benefits a lot of people. So that’s a public good. \nAnd so we’re going to detect that and we’re going   to automatically subsidize it based on a formula. \nSo, the idea here is to really think about the   final goal of these as being like basically your \nsocial institutions, in the same way that like   markets are basically a social institution and \ndemocracy is basically a social institution. Vitalik Buterin: It is the same kind of thing and \ncould potentially work at the same scale except,   at least hopefully it doesn’t have laws that \nsome of these other existing mechanisms do. So   that’s the kind of high level idealistic pitch \nfor it. And of course, quadratic funding is one   of the ideas. There’s also quadratic \nvoting. There’s also Harberger taxes,   there’s also all these other things. And \nthe idea there is basically that we have   all of this really interesting work on mechanism \ndesign that happened over the last century. Let’s   actually use it and let’s use it to build things \nthat can encourage people to cooperate better. Robert Wiblin: So, you mentioned that \nthere’s these issues with quadratic   voting and quadratic funding, that they’re \nvulnerable to kind of one person pretending   to be lots of people and potentially benefiting \nfrom that. I guess there’s also this issue of,   at least with the quadratic funding, it \nneeds matching funding in order to give   people sufficient incentive to like vote \nor provide their own funding to the right   extent. Is there any alternative to just using \nkind of taxes to provide that matching funding? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, and ultimately the funding \nhas to come from somewhere and basically it is   like in a blockchain context you could … If \nthis becomes popular in Ethereum or in like   other blockchains like Zcash. I talked to Zooko \nand he’s definitely interested in the idea of   just like printing a quantity of Zcash that \ngets automatically put into a matching pool.   Potentially governments and tax revenue are \ndefinitely the thing that you would need to use   of some kind if you want to do it on a large \nkind of really society wide scale. I mean,   it doesn’t have to be the same taxes that \nwe use today. Like Glen also has been doing   a lot of research into Harberger taxes as \none example. But in general, the idea that   instead of efficiency decreasing taxes, we \ncan try to have efficiency increasing taxes. Vitalik Buterin: And there’s a lot of a really \ninteresting work being done there. So the kind   of big slogan that Glen likes to use is “Tax \nthe congestable and subsidize the increasing   returns.” So basically we take all of the things \nthat people do that are zero sum activity,   put taxes on that, then take that money and \nthen basically shard it over and use it to   subsidize public road projects that people do \nfor each other. And that’s a really wonderful   kind of one sentence formula for like how to do \npolitical economy well, so that’s interesting. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. What are Harberger taxes? Vitalik Buterin: Harberger taxes are this \nidea that, for a thing that gets taxed,   basically the owner has to set a price for \nit and they pay a property tax that’s like   some percentage of that amount every \nyear, but then the price that they set   is a price at which anyone else can go \ncome in and basically buy it from them. Robert Wiblin: Are there any mechanisms that   you’re excited about other than kind of \nquadratic voting or quadratic funding? Vitalik Buterin: I mean, prediction markets are \nprobably one big example. And I think in addition   to kind of public good providing institutions, \nwe need better info institutions, and instead of- Vitalik Buterin: Need better info institutions, \nand things that are prediction market flavored,   definitely seem really interesting there. And \nthey don’t have to be exactly kind of prediction   markets, in the way that Robin Hanson designed \nthem. They could be even just the idea that you   would have to put down a bond, and that bond \ngets taken away if some negative event happens,   in exchange for putting down a bond, you would be \nable to have the ability to increase the extent,   to which something gets done \nthat does have some risk. Vitalik Buterin: There is a lot of \ndifferent ways to permute and apply   the concept. Whether we’re talking about \nimmigration policy, or whether we’re talking   about trade-offs involving different kinds \nof risks. Whether we’re talking about just,   what policy to apply to achieve some particular \nknown measurable objective in general. They’re   definitely not a tool that you can use for \neverything. I think the reason being that   prediction markets work well when the objective \nis known, but the objective is not always known. Vitalik Buterin: And figuring out the objective \nis often more than half the challenge. But at   the same time, I do think that they are \nquite underused today. And I think one of   the reasons I’m excited about blockchains is \njust the possibility that they could open up   more room for using like prediction markets, \nand kind of security deposit-like things. Robert Wiblin: You mentioned earlier \nthat there’s this really important   issue of establishing online \nidentity, to prevent collusion,   or to limit collusion. Can you explain, or \ngive an example of how collusion can damage   these mechanisms? And maybe what kind of a \nwork is being done, maybe by you or others,   to create a trustworthy identity system, \nsuch that we can get around these problems? Vitalik Buterin: Sure. First of all, these \nare problems that are wrecking the internet,   even today. You have these click farms where \npeople just buy up a few thousand phones,   they buy up thousands of accounts, and then \nthey use these accounts to just vote for things,   to push messages that they want to promote, to \nmanipulate a lot of different kinds of mechanisms. Vitalik Buterin: And once we start using these \nkinds of mechanisms to allocate resources in   more substantial ways, with things like quadratic \nfunding, then there’s a huge incentive for people   to buy up a bunch of accounts, and pretend to be \na big crowd of people that all cares about some   specific problem and all throw a bit of money \ninto it and then just extract subsidies. For   any kind of voting mechanism, you can use these \nsorts of things to swing votes, and you can use   these to manipulate online conversations, \nand all of these different problems. Vitalik Buterin: Basically, \nwe need to have mechanisms   that identify who is a unique human that are \nmore robust and that are more resistant to   people just either creating a bunch of entirely \nfake identities, or taking existing identities   and end up buying them, or renting them for \ndifferent things. And that’s something. It’s   a really hard problem. It’s a problem that \neven governments have a hard time solving. Vitalik Buterin: It’s a problem that \ncorporations have a hard time solving.   Centralized services have to keep on fighting,   and even they don’t really have especially \ngood solutions. It is the sort of problem,   though, where if we don’t solve it in some \nkind of reasonably secure way, then a lot of   these quadratic funding based and other kinds \nof mechanisms just can’t end up working well. Robert Wiblin: So I guess with \nnormal voting, people show up. Yeah,   people show up to the voting booth, and they \nsay their name, and I guess for some reason,   there isn’t as much of an issue with voter \nfraud, at least in the countries that I’ve lived,   than what you might expect. I guess a bank uses \npassports, which are maybe too hard to copy. I   mean, are we going to have to go for something \nas a system as costly as that, do you think,   in order to solve this problem? Or is it possible \nthat the problem is insurmountable, and it will   just make it non-practical to use quadratic \nfunding or voting in the real world, for anything   other than, something where you can require that \neveryone actually rock up somewhere personally. Vitalik Buterin: I think there’s definitely \nalways going to be some dollar value at   which you can obtain fake identities of \ndifferent kinds on the black market. So   I think it’s also definitely important for \nus to continue to research on making things   like quadratic funding be more robust \nto identity theft. And as I mentioned,   one of the recent posts I made on ethresear.ch \nis about changing the quadratic funding formula,   so that it does put a bound on the amount of \nsubsidies that you can minimalistically extract   from the system, if you have ‘n’ identities. \nSo yeah, things like that are important. Robert Wiblin: So that might be something \nlike a minimum contribution for each person? Vitalik Buterin: It’s not a minimum contribution. \nIt’s more a maximum subsidy for a pair of people.   Yeah. So there’s that, and there is also \nof course the possibility of trying to make   identities that are more robust, and that work \nbetter. I mean, there’s definitely things that   you can try to do, to solve it. One other \nproblem that you’d end up going up against,   if you try to make systems for this, that \nare universal, is hostile governments. Like,   North Korea prints fake hundred dollar bills, \nso why can’t they print fake passports? And so,   you’ve got Kim Jong-Un with a click-farm of a \nmillion fake North Koreans that are claiming   there’s this obvious really important \npublic goods that we have to give money to. Vitalik Buterin: So basically things like \nthat. And it’s definitely a challenge,   and it’s definitely the sort of challenge where \nonce again, it’s not fully insurmountable,   but also not fully surmountable. And so we \njust have to get out into the real world,   and like keep trying, keep seeing what the issues \nare, and keep improving it over time. We’ll see. I   mean there’s definitely a chance that the identity \nissues are going to be too big, but I hope not. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Who’s doing the most \nimpressive work on this? And is it mostly,   do you think, a social or political problem, or \nis it more a technical cryptographic problem? Vitalik Buterin: Some of both. Like \nthe anti-collusion stuff is definitely   cryptographic. And to figure out who’s a real \nperson problem, is partially mathematical,   because often you can use things like graph theory \nand minimal cuts, and all of these things to   try to figure out how to actually aggregate the \ninformation to figure out who’s probably a real   person, and who isn’t, but also partially a social \nproblem of, how do you present these mechanisms,   and how do people participate in which \nmechanisms you use. So it’s some of both. Robert Wiblin: I’ve read that you’re more excited   about quadratic funding than \nquadratic voting. Why is that? Vitalik Buterin: So quadratic voting is \ninteresting too, but there’s unsolved questions   with it. So, one big example is that with \nquadratic voting you still need to have someone   who figures out what’s going to be up for a vote. \nAnd the ability to put something up for a vote,   is a really huge amount of power, right? Because \nfor example, one of the use cases for quadratic   voting is that it protects minorities, right? And \nso, if you have quadratic voting on all the laws,   then if someone comes up with laws that benefit \na majority slightly, but really hurts a minority,   then regular voting is going to pass those \nwalls, but quadratic voting is not. But then   here’s the challenge. Let’s imagine we have a \nworld where 10% of the people are blue-eyed,   and 90% of the people are anti-blue eye-ists. \nAnd they want, kind of, but not to the point   where they die for it, to have a genocide \nof blue-eyed people and kill them all. Vitalik Buterin: So, this is sort of set up, where \nif you set up a regular majority vote to just kill   all the blue-eyed people, maybe two thirds \nwould vote in favor, a bunch would not care,   and all the blue-eyed people would vote against. \nAnd so the blue eyed people would lose. In a   single quadratic vote, the blue eyed people care \nabout not dying more than the anti-blue eye-ists   care about killing them. And so they would win. \nBut if one person had the ability to just keep   on putting things up for a vote, and that one \nperson was an anti-blue eye-ist, what he would do,   is he would just keep on raising the question. \nAnd so every time there’s a vote, everyone   would have to make these votes, and everyone \nwould have to pay money to make these votes. Vitalik Buterin: But the problem \nis that the anti blue eye-ists   would lose, but because there’s more of them, \nthey’re more spread out, they would have to pay   less, and the blue-eyed people would have to pay \nquadratically more. Like the blue-eyed people,   their votes are maybe 10 times stronger, but \nthey’d have to pay a hundred times more money for   that. And so if you keep raising the issue, then \neventually you just bankrupt the blue-eyed people,   and then you raise the issue for a vote \nagain, and so blue-eyed get killed. So … Robert Wiblin: But this seems \nlike a pretty devastating problem. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. I mean it’s … this is \nthe problem with voting mechanisms in general,   like there’s this very large design space \nof what can be put up to a vote and when   and under what conditions, and even democracies \nhave very different rules for when elections can   happen with very different consequences. And \nyou know, it wreaks very different outcomes.   Whereas quadratic funding is really nice because \nthe mechanism really is unopinionated in that   way. Right? With quadratic funding, you just \nhave projects. Anyone can spin up a project,   anyone can donate money to a project and then you \nhave subsidies. And that’s it. It is really nice   and clean and neutral and that’s that. So that’s \na property that I really like about the mechanism. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. There’s this website, \nschoolvoting.net which has a couple of pages   which have pretty vociferous critiques of \nquadratic voting, I think including the one   that we were just talking about. To be honest, \nI found the articles a little bit hard to follow   and a bit ranty. But I saw you responding to \nthem on Twitter. Do you want to comment on   whether there’s any other problems and \nI guess how convincing you found those   articles? And maybe also do any of the critiques \nfrom that site carry over to quadratic funding? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah that critique on the site \nwas definitely really ranty but the critiques   of quadratic voting in general that I think I \nhear the most about, I mean one of them, and   this doesn’t apply to quadratic funding, is this \nissue of who makes the vote and who decides what’s   up for a vote. And I think that’s definitely a \nbig issue. It’s not a deal breaker, it doesn’t   mean that you can’t have quadratic votes, but it \ndoes mean that they’re not a universal replacement   for things. Whereas quadratic funding it doesn’t \nhave that issue, which is nice. The other class   of critiques of all these public good mechanisms \nthat I feel the radical exchange movements doesn’t   pay enough attention to is, kind of rational \nignorance and rational irrationality issues. Vitalik Buterin: So basically the size of \nincentive that an individual person has   to form a correct opinion of any of these \ntopics is tiny. I mean Bryan Caplan wrote   this big book on “The myth of the rational \nvoter”, where he basically… A big core part   of why he likes capitalist libertarianism \nwhich is basically that people are good   at making decisions when the consequences \naffect just them personally, but they’re   terrible at thinking through issues carefully \nwhen their individual contribution to an issue,   it’s so tiny. They don’t really have any incentive \nor social pressure to be correct. And so all of   these other irrational human biases, instead \nof just having an influence, end up dominating   completely. And so if you think of some farmer \nin Texas, if you think about what incentive he   has to form a correct opinion on anthropogenic \nglobal warming, the answer is basically not. Vitalik Buterin: His incentive is to have opinions \nthat make him look good in front of his friends,   essentially. And there’s definitely plenty of \ncases where people do have very correct opinions   on things despite not having an incentive to. \nSo I’m definitely not claiming incentives are   always necessary but at the same time, there is \ndefinitely this issue and quadratic mechanisms   do mitigate it, but do they mitigate it \ncompletely? Definitely not. And the score   voting guy even did the math and pointed out how \nif you use quadratic voting to run an election,   the average person would end up paying \ntwo cents. And are two cents worth of   incentive really going to end up changing \nanyone’s opinion? Probably not. Right?   So that’s one issue. And then also in \ngeneral, if you go out into the world,   there is plenty of unsavory organizations that \nended up exploiting some combination of biases,   lack of education, all of these things to pretty \nsuccessfully extract money from a lot of people. Vitalik Buterin: You have Ponzi schemes, MMM \nand pyramids and all of these things. And   then if you started talking about, “Oh, well we’re \ngoing to create a scheme where if enough people   donate money to someone that person gets even more \nmoney” then that could end up supercharging cults. Robert Wiblin: Interesting. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, it’s definitely \nsomething that I worry about. But this   is one of these sorts of empirical questions that \nyou can’t really figure out easily ahead of time.   You pretty much have to run the mechanism at \nsmall scales whether or not the results of the   mechanism are of high quality and if they \nare, you keep on going from there. If this   sort of thing ends up being a problem, then \none category of a solution that, once again,   I think radical people generally don’t think \nabout enough is sortition. So if the problem   is that you’re asking people to express opinions \nabout all of these issues, and they don’t have   enough incentive to really come up with the \ncorrect opinions, and they don’t even have   enough time to come up with correct opinions, \nthen why not just force them to specialize? Vitalik Buterin: So for any project that has more \nthan a million people that participate in it,   use a random number generator select a random \n0.1% of people, only those people are allowed to   contribute. Then you multiply their contributions \nby, I forget, it’s either a thousand or a square   root of a thousand, whatever the right factor \nis and compensate. And then suddenly each one   of the 0.1% of people that do contribute is \nmaking a significant change to the output.   And so they have more of an interest in actually \nfiguring out what a sort of correct answer would   be. So that’s one category of a solution \nthat could be worth exploring I think. Robert Wiblin: How serious a problem with smart \ncontracts, I guess any process or mechanism that   gets locked into a blockchain, is it that we have \nto then establish clearly ahead of time exactly   what we want to contract about? And usually \nfiguring out exactly what the goal should be,   there’s usually a lot of ambiguity in \ncontracts. A lot of like negotiation that   goes on between parties after a contract is \nsigned on exactly what they intended in order   to avoid them having to like bargain forever \nup front. How serious a problem is that with   smart contracts in terms of limiting \ntheir potential application in future? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, so I think this is \nthe same problem as the Oracle problem,   which is the contracts don’t understand the real \nworld very well. And it’s definitely a limitation   to what contracts can do, right? You’re not \ngoing to modify an employment contract and then   get rid of employer and employees, that’s not \nhow it works. Smart contracts are a much more   specific tool that is about, “Hey, here are the \nmathematical rules of an economic interaction   that we want to have and lets formalize the things \nthat we can formalize.” And there are going to be   inputs that have to come from the outside. And if \nthere are, then we can formalize where the inputs   come from. But that’s a specific encapsulated \nthing that you can you can worry about separately. Vitalik Buterin: So there’s definitely cases where \nsmart contracts make a lot of sense. For example,   there’ve been people recently trying to \ncompare their freak insurance which is   basically contracts that automatically pay out \nif there’s a drought or if there’s hurricane or   if the temperature goes above some number and \nthere is a project doing this for Puerto Rico,   there’s a project doing this for Sri Lanka. So \nthat’s the sort of area where you do need to get   some data from the outside world but the amount of \ndata you need to get from the outside is going to   be limited. And it’s a thing that you can design \nan entire system around and make sure the system   works well and then once you have the system \nthen it becomes easier to build these things   on top of it and at least conditional on the \nOracle working, the rest of the system is also   guaranteed to work. So you know, and that’s \nthe sort of things smart contracts can do. Robert Wiblin: This made me think. So this \nissue with quadratic voting where you have   the problem of exhausting people’s votes by \nputting up the same idea again and again. The   UK parliament for example, has a rule that you \ncan’t put up the same substantive thing for a   vote more than once in the same parliamentary \nsession. I wonder if you have enough of a human   element in it where people, trusted elected \nrepresentatives are acting like the speaker   does in the UK parliament to control the flow \nof who speaks and what gets voted on. Did you   think that something like that could help \nto make it work a bit better in practice? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I mean the human \nelement is definitely the reason why the   formal systems that exist in the real world \ntoday don’t break completely despite there   being the possibility of edge cases that could \nbreak them completely. Right? The reason why I   don’t need to go around getting signatures \nfrom 200 million people to turn on a light   bulb is because we have courts that have common \nsense and that have decided that me shooting   photons at other people’s houses at that scale \nis not a property rights infringement. And the   reason why shareholder governance continues \nto work okay is in part because we have these   minority shareholder protections. The reason \nwhy votes continued to work okay is in part   because we have these constitutional rules \nthat say here is examples of things that you   can’t set vote for. And these kinds of exceptions \nare definitely important in improving outcomes   but if you have too much room for them then \nthere is a really huge cost of that as well. Vitalik Buterin: So one example of this is the \nfamous fact that there’s so many federal crimes   out there that pretty much everyone is guilty \nof doing at least some felony everyday. And so   you have no way to not be vulnerable to a legal \nattack if the legal system really wanted to go   after you. And so the more you have exceptions \nand these kinds of case by case situations that   sometimes they help you but also the more \nthey’re something that’s exploitable and   that becomes really hard to work around. And \nin this case, sure, you could say that you   can’t vote on the same substantive thing multiple \ntimes, but then who defines what is substantive?   Is that something going to turn into a partisan \nweapon in the hands of the wrong activist judges? Vitalik Buterin: And I don’t know. Right. \nSo the idea that I think is the spirit   behind the radical exchange movement, the \nradical exchange movement has many spirits,   but the one that I want to narrow down on here \nis basically that if we can design formal systems   where the formal system comes somewhat closer \nto being optimal, then you still will need the   rules to kind of figure out what the exceptions \nare. But the number of rules are going to have to   be fewer in number. And so because of that, you \nstill get a lot of benefits. You know, in the   case of quadratic voting, you’d have to have \nrules about what it is that you can vote on,   but alternatively in the case quadratic funding, \nyou need fewer of that. And so that’s one of the   reasons quadratic funding in particular is \nthis flavor that I’m really excited about. Robert Wiblin: So yeah, I guess I’m feeling a \nlittle bit more pessimistic about all of this,   well this is radical exchange \nproject, than I did half an hour ago. Vitalik Buterin: There’s definitely a \nlot of challenges. But at the same time,   it’s important to remember that, \nfirst of all, if we can make it work,   then this is really huge. We’re talking about \na general purpose infrastructure for funding   public goods in the same way that money is \ngeneral purpose infrastructure for funding   private goods. Like this is something that really \ncould supercharge the information society. Second,   the fact that we’re starting to think through \nproblems is not a sign to be pessimistic because   really every existing social institution that \nwe have has a huge number of problems too. Vitalik Buterin: And we just don’t think about \nthem because they’re sort of normal, right? So for   example, I talk about like “is this supercharged \ndonation gadget going to empower cults?” And then   you realize that honestly the largest country in \nthe world kind of is run by one already, right? Vitalik Buterin: So yeah, and then with \nall of these things like identity issues,   it’s a challenge but then just regular \nvoting depends on identity issues too.   And we’ve eventually managed to stabilize it. Vitalik Buterin: Even by my own standards, regular \ncorporate governance like governance of companies   with shareholders. I think it’s completely \neconomically broken up, right? For the same   reason that coin voting is broken. And over the \ncourse of a few decades we’ve managed to figure   out patches and shareholder regulations \nand all these things that sort of make   it okay. So I think the goal here is to try to \nexperiment with things in these smaller contexts,   try to see if they work in these contexts, \ntry to identify very quickly what the problems   are and try to move towards solving them. \nAnd then I think it can definitely turn into   something really interesting in five to ten \nyears time, right? There’s utopian versions   of it that are going to be really hard. But then \nthere’s the less utopian versions of it, sticking   Harberger taxes on copyright, that could easily \nend up being really valuable and are one very   specific and well encapsulated thing. So I think \nit’s a push for the easier things at the same time   and analyze the moon while shooting for it. \nI think it’ll get somewhere very interesting. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. So I guess, if we could \nsolve all of these problems then the reason   to be excited is that we could potentially solve \na large fraction of all public goods provision,   which is one of the fundamental reasons \nthat the world sucks. But I guess you’re   saying even if we only at 10 or 20% of the \nway there, just by muddling through and   fixing these problems to a sufficient degree, \nthen that could still be a very big reward. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. I mean 10 to 20% \nof the way in the same way that zero to   one is 10% of the way there from zero \nto ten. It’s both 10% and also not 10%. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Speaking \nof corporate governance,   have there been any experiments to try \nto use these innovative governance and   incentive mechanisms in the governance of \nEthereum and other other crypto projects? Vitalik Buterin: So I mentioned Gitcoin grants, \nright? It’s this quadratic funding gadget that’s   funded with about $50,000 every couple of months. \nSo that’s been running and it’s been, despite the   occasional problems, it’s been giving outputs that \nI think are pretty good and match projects that   I think are good and valuable. So yeah, and the \nmain challenge at this point is we need a whole   lot of work on figuring out identity. On collusion \nresistance, the projects that I mentioned, it’s   already being worked on by some cryptographers \nand they should have something else pretty soon. Robert Wiblin: Are there any mechanisms \nthat you might be able to design where   people don’t benefit from collusion \nor you know, pretending to have   multiple identities or pretending to have \nfewer identities than they really have? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I mean money is \nprobably the simplest example of that   kind of mechanism. Right? Because people paying \n$10 to something is not treated differently from   one person paying $20 to the same thing. And \nthe way that I think about the importance of   collusion resistance is that in a lot of cases \nyou can show that a large class of mechanisms,   if you allow for the possibility of \ncollusion, basically reduces to being money,   right? If you have a mechanism that says \npeople can give each other points, but then   people give each other points publicly and so I \ncan give you points in exchange for you giving   me points. Then the entire thing collapses into \nequilibrium and what’s left is a money system. Robert Wiblin: And I guess the \nreason we don’t want that is   that we want to limit the power of \nthe people who have the most money? Vitalik Buterin: We want to have money \nsystems, but money systems are good for   private goods. They’re not good for public goods. \nSo we want to have these other than money systems   as well. And the other class of things that \ndoesn’t require an identity, which is nice,   is info institutions. So prediction markets \nand things that look like prediction markets   are probably one big example there. And \nI’m really interested in those as well. Robert Wiblin: Okay. Yeah. Hopefully \nwe’ll have time to talk about futarchy   a little bit more in a minute. But to get \neven more ambitious let’s talk a little   bit about whether any of these mechanisms \ncould replace governments or even have an   influence on international relations. So from \nthat paper I quoted earlier, it moves on to   talking about what influence a cryptography \ntechnology might possibly in the future be   able to have on international relations or in \npromoting international cooperation and peace. Robert Wiblin: And it says, “In addition, \nthe need to establish the credibility of   one’s commitments in the absence of other \nmechanisms has often been cited as at least   a reason for participating in prolonged wars, \nthe Vietnam war, as a notable case. The number   of lives lost, risked and harmed because of \nan absence of good tools to make credible   international commitments would difficult \nto overstate. Therefore, given the stakes,   the possibility that smart contracts could \nhave applications in the international sphere   is very much worth investigating. For example, \nsmart contracts might enable countries to more   credibly commit to international agreements \nthat include penalties for non compliance,   for instance, those that seek reductions in \ngreenhouse gas emissions.” So yeah. What’s   your action to that? Is this something that \nis probable enough that it’s worth pursuing? Vitalik Buterin: It’s definitely \ninteresting, but then there’s also   challenges. As I mentioned the Oracle problem \nand the challenge that on geopolitical scales,   the Oracle problem is this serious Oracle \nbecause regardless of who’s the Oracle,   North Korea can probably find some way to hack \nthat. So, you know this is not as easy as saying,   “Here’s a smart contract that pays us a pile \nof money if we denuclearize”, because how the   hell does a smart contract know whether or not \nyou’ve denuclearized? Yeah, I think that’s the   biggest challenge now that could get alleviated \nsomewhat when we have more things that are running   on the blockchain. So when we have, for example, \ncurrencies get issued there and a lot of identity   systems running on it, like carbon credits being \ntraded on blockchains and things like that,   then you can start making smart contracts off of \nit, which I think could be really interesting. Vitalik Buterin: And there definitely are \nprojects that are trying to do things like   putting carbon credits on a blockchain \nto make them internationally tradable   more easily. So I definitely put a lot of \nvalue on things like that. I mean also in   international contexts. One way to look at \nit is to try to improve coordination ability   between state actors. The other possibility is \nimproving coordination ability between people   who are not state actors. So like making \ncarbon credits tradable internationally,   is one example of that sort of thing. \nOtherwise there’s also these issues   with certain certification and trying to make \nthose work securely and blockchains could   definitely be part of that. There’s definitely \npeople really actively thinking about it. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Are there any other \npossible ways that the crypto technology   could help, like with international relations \nor peace or international coordination? Robert Wiblin: Yeah, like with \ninternational relations or peace   or international coordination. Or government \nthat you’d be interested in highlighting? Vitalik Buterin: See, credible commitments are \ndefinitely one you… Being a backbone for quadratic   mechanisms and these other kinds of things at \nscale is possibly another, you know, and those   are probably the big ones. A third one is also \njust making regular kinds of markets more and more   international. But the challenge there is just, \nit’s inherently a more long term thing because   when the stakes are high, that would imply that \npeople have a large incentive to attack a block   chain or attack an Oracle. And we’re definitely \nnot at the stage of blockchains being resistant to   attacks and definitely not at a stage of Oracles \nbeing resistant to attacks on that kind of scale. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. So, so the point of Oracles \nis that sometimes, well for many functions,   the blockchain has to know what actually happened \nin the real world. Like, “Was there a hurricane   so should we pay out the insurance to people \nwho had hurricane insurance?” How close do you   think we are to having trustworthy oracles and is \nthat a problem that you think can be solved or is   that something where again, we just have \nto muddle through anddo a tolerable job? Vitalik Buterin: It depends what level of trust \nyou’re looking for. For kind of small scale things   I think we are there already. For large scale \nthings, I mean we’ll figure out things that kind   of work over the next couple of years, MakerDAO \nhas a huge incentive to come up with a model   that’s reasonable and right now they have some \nkind of multi-stake out of 13 Oracles and maybe   they’ll find ways to iterate and refine on that. \nAnd Augur has their decentralized Oracle for a   prediction market, I mean Kleros the blockchain \nbased decentralized port is doing oracle stuff. Robert Wiblin: How do those work? Vitalik Buterin: Basically the decentralized \noracles work by letting a random sample of   token holders vote on any issue. And then \nif some random sample votes incorrectly,   then a bigger sample can vote. And \nif it comes down to everyone voting,   then basically the token kind of splits in \nhalf and the theory is that the token on   which the token holders bode correctly \nis going to be the more valuable one. Robert Wiblin: And that’s been working tolerably? Vitalik Buterin: I think so. Yeah. And Augur \nis definitely been working okay for now. Robert Wiblin: I guess it will be \nvulnerable to someone who has a huge   incentive to manipulate it and is willing \nto spend a lot of money, potentially. Vitalik Buterin: Augur is definitely not \nsecure, or markets that are larger than the   value of all the Augur coins into existence. \nIn crypto economics it’s going to be a common   pattern that the systems are going to be as \nsecure as the market cap or their token but   not higher and maybe just have to wait \nfor the market cap to hopefully go up. Robert Wiblin: Are there any kind of other \ninitiatives or projects out there that you   think could benefit from crypto economic research, \nwhich will be particularly effective from kind of   an effective altruist point of view that \nit would be worth directing people to. Vitalik Buterin: I mean, so as far as specific \napplications go, I mean one idea that I have   talked to GiveDirectly people about is that you \ncan have GiveDirectly as a universal basic income,   but you can also have GiveDirectly \nas a quadratic funding gadget. Robert Wiblin: Explain that? Vitalik Buterin: Basically instead of giving \nevery single person X dollars and letting them   spend it how they want, just create a quadratic \nfunding gadget and seed it with the identities   in one of these communities and pump money \ninto that. And because we are talking about   communities where people are very poor, so small \namounts of money could help them quite a lot. But   these people don’t just have a need for private \ngoods. They also have need for public goods and so   if you can just seed a quadratic funding \nthing with a few million dollars,   then potentially it could end up \nbeing a way to really transform them. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. So that’s one example and \npublic good funding in general is obviously a kind   of feed-in for effective altruist problems \nbecause pretty much all effective altruist   problems are public good ones to a really large \nextent, and so me, I guess public goods funding   as a kind of a general problem is definitely \nthe thing that I’d focus on at the moment. Robert Wiblin: What kinds of people do \nyou think are kind of necessary to try   to get as many benefits from this strain \nof research? Is it kind of people who need   more technical crypto skills or people who \nknow economics and political economy and can   can develop the crypto economic side of \nthings, or was it perhaps something like   people who can build projects and \nmake them work? Or something else? Vitalik Buterin: I actually think \nat this point the thing that we’re   lacking is product people so to speak, like those   who specialize in taking these systems \nand making them work for users at scale. Robert Wiblin: Interesting. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. We have the economic \nreasoning. We have a lot of cryptographic and   mathematical reasoning, what we need’s, actually, \nfigure out how to deploy an identity system. We   need to figure out how to deploy quadratic funding \nof things with the right user interface so that it   actually works well kind of fairly quickly without \npeople not knowing what they’re supposed to do,   and all of these other things. It’s definitely \na problem and at that stage at this point. Robert Wiblin: Crypto these days \nkind of has a, blockchain in general,   has a bit of a reputation as being a \nbit of a scammy space and I wonder,   how much is that a limiting factor or \na challenge for organizations that are   gonna try to do these really novel projects \nthat people might find it hard to evaluate? Vitalik Buterin: It’s definitely a challenge and \nI definitely think that in general, blockchains   and crypto as a whole, are still viewed quite \npositively to the point where you have large   institutions getting excited about it. Like you \nhave these UNICEF groups making trials on watches   and all these other things. So I definitely don’t \nthink that the existence of Ponzi schemes and   scams and all of these things is preventing the \nspace from growing at all. It’s definitely a cost   and if we can find ways to solve the issue as I \ndefinitely think it can attract more people. But   for me, the kind of larger value of fighting the \nscams is basically that we’ll have less scams. Robert Wiblin: Let’s talk about futarchy \nagain, which you mentioned earlier. Explanation of futarchy Robert Wiblin: Yeah. You wrote about futarchy \nback in 2014 and discuss some of the pros and   cons of it. How do you feel about it \ntoday and do you think kind of yeah,   blockchain technology could be used \nto put it into practice, in any case. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I definitely think that \nfutarchy and using prediction markets as an input   to decision making is really interesting and as I \nmentioned you know, security deposits are sort of   a sudden loss of liquid but like related customs \nor prediction markets. And those are really   interesting too. I think the main challenge \nwith say, using futarchy to run a country,   that I maybe didn’t realize a few years ago that I \nrealize more now is basically, how do you set the   objective, and if you talk to AI researchers then \nyou know that setting the objective is a really,   really big problem and if you set it incorrectly \nin the face of a really powerful optimizing force,   then you created very bad consequences and that \nexists with AI. But that exists with prediction   markets as well, right? Because if you’re \ngoing to create a prediction market of say,   the average life expectancy and you’re \ngoing to use that to run health policy. Vitalik Buterin: Well, what some guy \nis going to do is he’s going to come up   with a policy that basically says kill all \nthe people that are statistically expected   to have a low average life expectancy \nand that’s going to push the number up,   and so if you just pre-coordinate an automated \nmechanism, then that thing is going to basically   voted for them. So that’s the sort of thing that \ndefinitely is a bigger challenge. But there are   definitely cases where the objective like is \nknown. Right? So one way in which you can kind   of solve this problem sometimes is you combine \na prediction market together with some other   form of governance, it could be a quadratic \nvote or a regular vote or something else. Vitalik Buterin: So I adjusted this idea that \nif you want to create a unique identity system,   then one of the ways in which you can do that \nis you can have basically a prediction market   where you can just predict, which of these \naddresses correspond to real people and you   need to have some threshold amount of money \nto vouch for you before you can be inducted   into the system. And then the prediction \nmarket just is on this mechanism where   if enough money challenges a person, then it \ncomes to some vote and then the vote decides   is this person actually a human or not? \nAnd if the vote decides that they’re not   a human, then you penalize everyone who \nsupported them on the prediction market. Vitalik Buterin: Right. So the idea there \nis that the objective, which is basically,   “Is this person a human according to this \nother mechanism that we assume we trust,   and mathematical rule defines?”, Then the \nproblem doesn’t exist to the same extent.   But if your problem is, “I have money, how do \nwe use this to do the most good?” Then that’s   harder to define. And so prediction markets are \nnot just magically going to solve that for you. Robert Wiblin: So yeah, very often \nkind of collective action problems   persist because of transaction costs. \nLike search costs, bargaining costs,   the cost of making and enforcing commitments. \nIs it right to imagine that one of the main   ways that the blockchain could \nhelp solve these problems is by   reducing those costs kind of one way or \nanother? Is that, is that a good framing? Vitalik Buterin: In some cases, yes. I think the \nword ‘transaction costs’ is one of these really   misleading things because it refers to really \nunrelated concepts. The reason why we’re not   working collectively to fund public goods more is \nnot the same category of thing at all as the 2.5%   being charged by PayPal. Right? They’re not the \nsame. Even though both are technically transaction   costs, they’re totally not the same class of \nthing. And the reason why that’s important to   emphasize is because as markets become more \nefficient, one of those kinds of things goes   down. But the other kind of thing is definitely \nnot at all guaranteed to go down. And sometimes it   even goes up if you end up accidentally disrupting \ntraditional existing structures or coordination. Vitalik Buterin: The kind of inefficiencies that \nare preventing more public good provision are in   a specific kind of thing that you do need \nto approach it a specific way. Just like   the efficiencies or the inefficiencies in \nprivate property leading to monopolies are   a specific kind of thing that you have to \napproach in a specific way and commitment   problems are a specific thing that you have to \napproach in a specific way. And then the same   thing with inefficiencies in information \nsystems and all of these other issues. So   they definitely kind of solve problems, \nbut I do think that you want to have a   framing that recognizes that we are dealing \nwith many different kinds of pieces here. Robert Wiblin: What’s your view \nof Facebook’s Libra project? Vitalik Buterin: Ooh, that’s a fun one. So I guess \nin terms of what their motivations are and I think   a big one is just that Facebook is seeing that \nWeChat is getting into payments and that WeChat is   really successful. So Facebook needs to make their \nnext move, and so Facebook should be getting into   payments as well and try to become this kind \nof omnibus app, and then if they’re going to   get into payments, the question is how do they \ndo it? And the problem is if you do it through   traditional banking and you want to be available \nin all these different countries, then there’s   just so many of these regulatory complexities \nthat you have to go through. And so the theory   is that if they do it as a cryptocurrency, \nthen it’s simpler for them in a bunch of ways. Vitalik Buterin: So that’s kind of my read of part \nof what their motivations are. And another thing   is, they kind of have to get into payments because \ntheir existing business model, which is basically   monetizing people’s data is something that’s kind \nof coming under political attack and we can expect   it to come under political attack even more. And \nso they need something else. So from that side,   the incentives definitely line up for \nthem to do that. And on top of that,   I think that people inside of Facebook, they are \nSilicon Valley people and I’m sure many of them   take the critiques about how Facebook is wrecking \nthe world and everyone’s privacy to heart. And so   they want to do better. And Zuckerberg did \nthat release that memo a few months ago about   how he wants to push for Facebook \nin a more pro-privacy direction. Vitalik Buterin: Libra’s base layer privacy at \nthis point definitely sucks, but pushing Facebook   in a not hegemonic direction. That might’ve \nbeen their intent though. And at the same time,   obviously they failed in a bunch of ways \non delivering on that because everyone just   still associates it with being Zuckerberg coin, \nwhich has the exact thing that they really tried   not to be by creating this association with \n28 different members. So yeah. And I guess   given that the thing is, to a large extent, \nthis kind of political and regulatory play,   it’s the political and regulatory responses \nthat are really going to decide it’s fate. Robert Wiblin: So you think \nfrom a technical standpoint   it’s okay? So it’s more a \nquestion of the politics? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. I mean \nfrom a technical standpoint,   a lot of it’s just the same as Ethereum. Robert Wiblin: Are there any blockchain projects   that you think are just stupid \nand that you wish didn’t exist? Vitalik Buterin: It starts \nwith a T and rhymes with cron. Robert Wiblin: Okay. Vitalik Buterin: Well, no, \nrealistically more than half of them. Robert Wiblin: Interesting. Okay. Is there no \nkind of summing up what their main problem is? Vitalik Buterin: And there’s lot of projects that   just basically see blockchains \nas a way of doing a money grab. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Speaking of politics \nwith these projects that, how have you   found the challenge of making happy all of \nthe different kinds of constituencies that   Ethereum has? I guess like people who hold it, \nthe developers, the people who were involved   in the foundation. I imagine this like a lot \nof challenges and potential tensions there. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, it’s definitely a \nbig challenge. Especially more recently   now the community has been growing a huge \namount since around 2017. Before it was   much tighter and everyone was talking to \neach other really frequently. But now it’s   gotten to the point where you can clearly \nidentify sub-tribes forming and that’s both   inevitable and there’s risk associated with it. \nSo even just figuring out the next steps in the   Ethereum roadmap are something just keeps on \nrequiring more and more in a consensus building.   And first of all it’s good because it means the \nplatforms getting more decentralized, but on the   other hand it’s important to make sure that it \ncontinues to be able to actually move somewhere. Robert Wiblin: I guess to wrap up this section, do \nyou think that the kinds of approaches to making   the world better that we’ve been talking about, \ncrypto economics, blockchain, these incentive   and design mechanisms, are they kind of underrated \nby people and that we should be seeing more smart   people moving into them? Or do you think they’re \nmaybe appropriately rated or maybe even overrated   and maybe too many people are trying to make them \nwork relative to the difficulty of the challenges? Vitalik Buterin: By the world at large, it’s \ndefinitely underrated. The world at large   I think at this point still sees crypto as just \nbeing a coin thing and maybe a trust thing and   the subtleties around, “Let’s come up with \nways to make mechanism design work and let’s   get quadratic funding running on this thing, all \nof this other stuff.” I don’t think that’s kind   of gotten into the public consciousness yet. \nThere’s definitely an opportunity for it to,   it’s definitely the sort of thing where it does \nfeel like there is a sort of political moment   right now that’s favorable to it at least among \nsome communities. Inside of the existing groups,   there’s definitely large portions of the crypto \nspace that are overrated. And as I mentioned,   the whole “Let’s rescue the world from the evils \nof 2% annual inflation thing” is possibly one of   the parts that I’m the least excited about. \nBut there’s other aspects that are really   interesting too. So I guess it depends \nwhat aspect and who you’re talking to. Robert Wiblin: Maybe this is an aside, \nI wasn’t sure I wanted to go into,   but the people who are so concerned \nabout the federal reserve and inflation,   what is driving them? Because just as someone \nwho’s studied economics, I feel like monetary   policy is worked out reasonably well. Like \n2% inflation is maybe if anything too low,   what’s going on here that this is such an \ninterest for a significant number of people. Vitalik Buterin: I think first of all there’s \nthis entire heritage of Austrian economics and   goldbugism and these kind of sister movements \nto libertarianism that have existed for a really   long time. And then a lot of people in the crypto \nspace like libertarianism and just historically   speaking, it has coevolved with these positions, \nand I can see why they’d be to these kinds   of positions because they basically say that we \nshould get the government out of the money supply   and it definitely is a sort of ideologically \naligned viewpoint in that sense. Vitalik Buterin: Also, the monetary stuff \nparticularly appeals to people given that   the main thing that kind of distinguishes \nthis kind of decentralized projects from   the ones that came before it is the fact that \nthere are coins inside of it. Yeah. I guess   if you’re going to ask me why Austrian \ngoldbugism attracts people in general,   it’s a political ideology. It attract \npeople for the same reasons as other   political ideologies that kind of claim to know \nbig secrets about how certain kinds of existing   institutions are totally screwing up and wrecking \neverything. It attracts certain kinds of people. Robert Wiblin: Do you worry that if \ncryptocurrencies did become the main   store of value or medium of exchange, that \nthe lack of a central bank that can engage in   monetary expansion could lead to more financial \ncrises or more macro economic destabilization? Vitalik Buterin: So it’s a good question. And \nI think first of all, governments do have a lot   of policy tools other than monetary expansion \nand contraction to use. So if, for example,   just one random thing in Singapore obviously \nthat I like is that apparently at one point,   the government adjusted the mandatory pension \ncontribution rates for employers downward during   a recession. So they basically use that as a \nlever to reduce employer’s side costs during   a recession, which is when you theoretically \nwant employers high costs naturally to go down,   so you don’t have to lay off lots of \npeople. Otherwise there’s fiscal policies   and all those tools that you can use. So I \ndefinitely don’t think that it’s going to,   cryptocurrency policies succeeding would take \nmonetary policies effectiveness down to zero. Vitalik Buterin: And another thing also \nis that if people use cryptocurrency as   a store of value but don’t use it as a \nunit of account, which seems extremely   likely because cryptocurrency is just \nway too volatile to be a unit of account,   then just adjusting the unit of account is still a \nhighly effective policy tool that governments are   going to have. So there are risks, but I think \nthere are opportunities and options as well. Robert Wiblin: Of all of the potential new \napplications that we’ve been talking about,   which ones do you think might we start to \nsee in the shorter term perhaps in you know,   some more modest form, like an actual application   that might get people excited and start \nreally helping with a real life project? Vitalik Buterin: Blockchain applications you mean? Robert Wiblin: Yeah, I was thinking out \nof the things like quadratic voting,   quadratic funding. Or collective decision \nmaking systems. Are there any ones that   you think might actually excite \npeople because they work soon? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. As far as radical \nstuff goes, I think internet forums are a   huge ground for innovation because incentives and \ncuration inside of internet forum environments is   definitely horribly screwed up in a whole bunch \nof ways, and so there’s a huge number of things   that potentially could be improved. It’s also \nthis kind of target that’s fairly insulated   from other things that’s very open to \ninnovation. You can try small things,   expand them over time. So I think it’s \na interesting area to start looking. Longtermism\nRobert Wiblin: All right,   let’s move on from talking about crypto to \ntalking about the longterm future of humanity   and existential risks, which is something you’ve \ntaken a bit of an interest in over the years. Vitalik Buterin: Yay. Robert Wiblin: Excellent. I guess to get \nstarted, what are your feelings towards   the kind of philosophy of long termism, which I \nguess for simplicity I’ll summarize as the view   that the most important moral consequences of \nour actions are impacts that happen more than   a hundred years in the future. And I guess that \nwe place too little weight on those impacts today. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, definitely, it does seem \nlike a perspective that’s really important,   that is definitely naturally easy for as \nhumans to just forget and not think about,   right. Because people who exist a hundred years \nfrom now don’t even exist today. And so if you   think about how little active effort people are \noften willing to put into just helping people who   exist today on the other side of the world. Well, \nhelping people who don’t even exist today and will   exist a century from now is definitely something \nthat comes even less naturally to people. Vitalik Buterin: So yeah, it’s something \nthat is valuable and it’s something,   where is clearly very large gains to be made as \nTyler Cowen pointed out in Stubborn Attachments.   If you hear about economic growth, then the \npositive consequences of pushing economic   growth off could potentially be pretty large \nbecause we’re talking about percentage points,   compounded over the course of a century which \ncould make a really big difference in the lives of   people. And existential risk reduction is another \nreally natural one there. So I guess support. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Do you feel like you \nhave an underlying moral philosophy that   drives the value that you place \nin the long-term future or just   other things that you value, like \nutilitarianism or something else? Vitalik Buterin: I guess I’m definitely less \nof a sort of one single big idea thinker,   and more of a, “Hey let’s do with things that \nseem to work reasonably well across a large   number of different perspectives” thinker. \nSo utilitarian values are definitely are a   really big part of that. But also basically \njust thinking about things that we really   should value or spend more time caring \nabout but don’t end up caring about for   reasons that just seem to not have any \nlogical backing behind them I suppose. Robert Wiblin: So more of a moral \npluralist. A bit like Tyler Cowen is. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. So I’d say so. Robert Wiblin: How common is long-termism \nwithin the communities that you’re involved   with and have you found any kind of \napproach to introducing those ideas   to other people or is it not something \nthat you particularly try to promote? Vitalik Buterin: I mean within the crypto \ncommunity there’s definitely a small pocket   of people that really care about these ideas. \nJeff Coleman is the other person in the Ethereum   community that really actively promotes these \nsorts of things. There are some others as well. So   there is a pocket that really care and \nthen a large other pockets that doesn’t. Robert Wiblin: Is the crypto community \npotentially a good place for people to,   I mean there’s lots of really smart people \nworking on it. I wonder if that’s a place   that maybe they should be more efforts to spread \nlong-termist ideas and get people more involved? Vitalik Buterin: I’d say so. I mean we’ve \ndefinitely have tried. We’ve, invited a Stewart   Brand from the Long Now foundation to speak \nat depth last year, and I think that was well   received. So I personally definitely believe \nin this idea that Ethereum should not just   be community about a cryptocurrency and should \nnot just be a community about de-centralization,   it should also be this kind of broader \nphilosophical community that reaches out to these   ideas that are potentially adjacent and really \naligned in the tribes and forge bonds there. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. You mentioned Tyler’s book \n‘Stubborn Attachments’. In my interview with him,   he suggested that, and I guess part \nof the thrust of the book is that a   good way for ordinary people who don’t want to \ndramatically change their lives to improve the   long-term future is to increase the rate \nof economic growth one way or another,   and I kind of put forward to him that this was a \nmuch less impactful per day of work than focusing   on risks from emerging technologies or promoting \ninternational peace or coordination or things   that are more targeted on stuff that seems like \nit affects the long-term future more than just   economic growth in general. Yeah. Who do you \nfeel you’re more sympathetic to on that issue? Vitalik Buterin: I don’t know. So when I say I’m \na pluralist, I think there is a huge amount of   just uncertainty about these issues, and I guess \nI tend to focus on doing things that seem like   they would have good consequences regardless of \nwhich ways some of these unknowns might end up   falling. So I guess the unknown here, well there’s \na bunch, right? So one of them is, what do you see   absolute size of existential risks today? Like, it \ncould be a 1% chance humanity is going to blow up   before the singularity, could be a 10% chance. It \ncould be a 65% chance and… do you have an answer? Robert Wiblin: More than 10%, \nless than 90% I’m not sure. Vitalik Buterin: That seems about right. Also \nin terms of economic growth there’s all these   knock-on effects. Society is richer than there \nis a more people that are going to be more free   to care about things other than materialism, and \nso you’re potentially going to increase the size   of the community of existential risk kind \nof people. If you get more economic growth,   you might have less conflict. I’m definitely \nby no means sold on economic growth as being   the number one thing to really be focusing on. \nI mean even just in terms of my own donations,   I’ve donated to projects that contribute \nto economic growth in Africa, but developed   countries less so unless you kind of count \nblockchains themselves as being in that area. Robert Wiblin: So as you mentioned, you \ndonated to AI safety research at MIRI,   the Machine Intelligence Research Institute and \nmaybe some other places as well? I’m not sure. Vitalik Buterin: For AI risk research. \nI think I’ve just done MIRI so far. Robert Wiblin: Well, what’s your \nperspective on the risks that   advanced AI systems might pose? Do \nyou have a particular take on what   risks are most likely and how you \nthink we ought to deal with them? Vitalik Buterin: The simple kind of 101 risk \nthat the AI risk people yell at you about,   which is basically that, “Hey, we’re going \nto make a super intelligent AI and then it’s   going to just kill us all in progress of solving \nsome other problem that it wants to solve without   even realizing it’s doing something we wouldn’t \nhave wanted it to do.” It’s definitely something   that’s plausible enough to be concerned about, \nand I’m definitely happy that there is this group   of people that’s actively pushing forward \non understanding that risk better so that   when the time comes and when much larger groups \nof people become really concerned about this,   there’s going to be a lot more existing road \nwork and research they can build off of. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. I’m not sure how \nmuch you follow but there’s kind of   multiple schools of thought. It’s kind of \nlike the MIRI folks tend to be more worried   about an AGI system that’s potentially quite \ndifferent than the kind of machine learning   that we use currently. And I guess they’re \ntrying to prepare to do the groundwork,   for how you might design that and ensure that \nit has a value function that is aligned with   what we want. And then there’s people who start \nmore with exactly the machine learning systems   that we have today and try to figure out, well \nhow do we make those more aligned, and imagine   what if we could develop a general artificial \nintelligence just by progressively powering up- Robert Wiblin: Develop like a general artificial \nintelligence just by progressively powering up   the current methods. Do you have any thoughts on \nthat? Do you kind of track that debate at all? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, and I’ve definitely \nseen presentations from people doing each one   of those approaches. I definitely think they’re \nboth like kind of really important because like   the approaches that are basically trying to kind \nof figure out alignment in more formal points of   view right now. Like, it’s definitely good \nthat there are people are working on that.   But on the other hand like if you have nothing \nto work with, there’s limits to how much you can   accomplish. Like, they have models that even say… \nThat implicitly assume that these AI’s are going   to have utility functions. But like what if the \nAI’s that we ended up creating don’t even work   by having well-defined utility functions. Right? \nLike what if we just basically keep on improving   GPT-2 until eventually it just predicts the \nactions of people well enough to act like   a human and it does a bit better than that. So \nit’s definitely, I think good that we have these   kind of approaches that are trying to improve \nalignment of the AI’s of today. Like, to cover   the possibility that the AIs that are going to \nbe superhuman do end up looking similar to that. Robert Wiblin: So your, your approach \nwould be to kinda to hedge your bets,   like do do a bit of both and then or like… \nAnd maybe other approaches that come up and   just kind of hope that one of them, one \nof them turns out to be the relevant. Vitalik Buterin: No, I mean as I mentioned,   I’m definitely kind of hardcore like hedge \nyour bets with your multiple approaches. Yeah. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Do you have any views on \nthe likelihood of kind of fast versus slow AI   take off scenarios or like when do you think \nwe might get like a general AI or is that,   I guess you’re probably pretty busy \ndealing with- with blockchain stuff   to maybe follow all of that, but I’m curious. Vitalik Buterin: I don’t know like if \nyou ask me to give numbers than the,   and I know the approach that I would take \nis probably similar to the approach that   I take for kind of very far mode techniques \naround predicting the future of technology   in general. Like I might say things like, \nOh well AI’s could win at chess 20 years   ago. They can win and Go and image recognition \nand these other things today. So like what’s   the the kind of difference between that \ndistance and the distance between today   and being more intelligent than humans. \nJust start figuring things out from there. Robert Wiblin: You wrote a blog post a little \nwhile back saying that you thought that kind   of both the crypto economics research \ncommunity and the and the AI safety and   existential risk community are kind of \ntrying to tackle what is fundamentally   the same problem. What is that problem \nlike? What connections do you see there? Vitalik Buterin: The problem is basically using \ndumb systems to control smart systems. So like   with crypto economics, the idea is that you have \nthese like very dumb incentive mechanisms and   you’re trying to use them to create incentives for \nhumans, corporations and potentially other actors   to participate and things like proof-of-stake \nand like layer two systems and whatever else that   you’re building in ways that are working in the \nintended function of the system. And you’re trying   to kind of guard against capture and against \npeople sort of gaining the system in unintended   ways. And AI research seems to be similar to that \nexcept that the kind of medium support system,   I mean it’s people and the really smart \nsystems controlling is this potentially   superintelligent AI. So there’s this sort of \nparallel between the formats of the two problems. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Do you think there \nare any lessons that either community   has kind of drawn today that is… That you \ncan like pool over to the other one that   maybe are there any like really important \ndisanalogies that we need to keep in mind? Vitalik Buterin: I mean the main thing is that \nthis would be the kind of second problem is   harder both kind of more unprecedented in terms \nof like who the kind of quote adversary is going   to be and how they’re going to look like. \nLike we’re not dealing with a set of agents,   we’re dealing with a single agent. Everything \ncould potentially happen much more quickly   and could be more difficult to stop if it \ndoes start going wrong. So like the second   problem is definitely in a lot of ways just a \nkind of more difficult version of the first,   there are potential parallels like for example \nin these incentive system. So like one of the   ways in which you can often sort of get smart \nresults out of dumb mechanisms is by pitting   smart agents against each other and the relying \ncompetition can get good outcomes. And you know   some of the AI safety research relies on \nadversarial networks in different ways. Robert Wiblin: And that’s something \nthat people will still use with smart   contracts where they are like \nkind of engaging competition   to try to find weaknesses in them \nand then improve them from that. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. Robert Wiblin: Interesting. Are \nthere any situations which you   could imagine going and working on \nAI safety research yourself at some   point if you came to think it was \na like a sufficiently large risk Vitalik Buterin: Potentially and that’s definitely \nthe sort of thing that I could definitely see   myself being really interested in at some point in \nthe future. Like I definitely think it’s a really   important problem I guess like you have to sort \nof distinguish between the thing I work on and the   thing that I think is the most important problem \nin the world, because like I have specialties   that… And like you have to work on things that \nare going to align with your specialty as well.   And doing crypto is definitely important, but \nit’s also, kind of has all of these things   around cryptography and economics that I \npersonally can do well. Whereas with AI issues,   like there’s definitely, there’s definitely \nkind of game theory in there, but it’s a lot of,   it’s kind of a different flavor. I know it would \ntake time to kind of get into the point there   being able to make significant contributions \ngiven where this space is at this point. Robert Wiblin: Are there any promising ways \nof improving the long-term future or kind of   threats to the long-term future of \nhumanity that particularly trouble you,   that, that you think maybe just have more,   more discussion, like existential risks \nthat people might be might be underrating? Vitalik Buterin: Well, let’s see. AI risk \ndefinitely is like very scary and it’s kind   of impact, but it’s definitely an already \nrated as such by that community. I mean   nuclear risks are definitely, I think \nway overrated by the general public. Robert Wiblin: Oh. Why is that? Vitalik Buterin: A nuclear war is \ngoing to kill 1 billion people,   but it’s not going to kill 7 billion. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. And I think it’s \nsomething that like probably the larger   part of the fallout from a nuclear war \nis not even going to be the explosion,   just all the people that die from like \nbasically global supply chain disruption. Yeah,   that’s like a thing that could be terrible but \nwe can easily recover from it in a couple of   decades. Whereas yeah, like the risks that \nwould just, that would actually kill like   all 7.6 billion of us are just like much worse \nbecause they sort of completely close off the   door to kind of humanity reaching the stars and \nunderline the more important historical things. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. So are \nyou a kind of skeptical about   like theories of nuclear winter or \nlike theories that nuclear winter   would be particularly extreme and kill \nlike far more than 1 billion people? Vitalik Buterin: I guess… I feel like those kinds \nof risks seem like risks that are manageable. Like   if nuclear winter comes, we definitely have ways \nto make the earth warmer and we know because we’ve   been doing a great job of that over the last \ncentury already. So there is definitely things   that like humanity can do work its way around if \nit sort of gets galvanized into it by necessity,   but things that just killed humanity you \nlike quickly while it’s still complacent   and by then we have no choice, no way to \nrecover. That seems like a scarier thing. Robert Wiblin: Are you completely confident or \nlike, you sound very confident that kind of,   we would recover if you know a billion people \ndied in nuclear war or maybe a bit more than   that. I guess do you worry that it could \nlead to like kind of a breakdown of like   international peace in general and kind \nof, yeah, like it’s kind of like that’s,   that’s the first trip on the stairs and \nthen we just keep… like things to keep going   worse and worse and we don’t automatically \nrecover to the situation that we’re at now. Vitalik Buterin: I mean if there’s one thing \nthat I learned from cryptocurrency price charts,   it’s that when things are going well, people \nunderestimate the potential for things to start   going poorly. But then when things are going \npoorly, people overestimate the possibility   that things will just keep on going poorly… poorly \nforever until they blow up completely. There is a   bottom and once things start picking up from the \nbottom, they can often start picking up quickly. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Do you have \nany, any thoughts on kind of other,   other threats to the future? I guess another \none that people talk about a lot is a kind of   risk from biotechnology. I’m not sure whether \nyou have the time to track that one at all. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, bio is definitely \na pretty big risk factor as well. Yeah,   and then the other, the reason why bio is like \npotentially scarier is because unlike nuclear,   we don’t need $1 billion strictly speaking to \nmake a weapon. It’s the sort of thing like nuclear   weapons I could totally expect the cost to build \none still being again in the billions or hundreds   of millions for quite awhile. Whereas with bio, I \ncould easily see it getting to the point of like   just being 3D printable at some point. Yeah, and \nthat’s, there’s definitely a lot of uncertainties   around that. Like if it gets really bad then like \nbasically, the only two stable equilibria are,   I mean one is to either have a totalitarian \nworld government that just like inspects like   basically all sufficiently advanced technological \nsupply chains and the other one is that people   stop living in cities like, a lot of problems \nbecome easier when you stop living in cities. Vitalik Buterin: Like in nuclear case, \nlike I did the math once and if you spread   out everyone equally across the entire \nearth’s surface then we say 7.6 billion   people divided by 150 million square \nkilometers of land mass gives you 51   people per square kilometer and at that rate \nnuclear bombs become a less cost-efficient way   of killing people than hiring samurais to run \naround with swords and like with bio as well,   right? Like the thing has to spread somehow and \nthere’s definitely the possibility of like second   and third generation stuff that just spreads \nacross the entire world through insects and   it comes up with a way of getting around \noceans and gets around other things, but… Robert Wiblin: That’s a heavy lift. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, it’s like a big lift, \nbut also just in general like us kind of moving   away from sort of city based like a very high \ndensity living is definitely something that I   think about sometimes. Like I can easily \nsee technology leading to it one of these   days. Sort of a partial move away away \nfrom that over the next century or so. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, so it’s a \nvery interesting proposal that   I’ve never heard before. I guess it’s \nlike something of an offensive strict   zoning requirements. Maybe we’ll have to \nbring back zoning in order to prevent the   bio apocalypse. I just worry that even if there \nwas a huge risk of everyone dying this way,   it would just be like too hard to coordinate \npeople to like provide a sufficient incentive to   get people to move away from cities because the \neconomic rewards of agglomeration are so vast. Vitalik Buterin: I mean people have a \nprivate incentive to move away from cities. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. I guess… I guess it has \nto be that the risk has to be demonstrated.   So I suppose like maybe you need a huge \ndisaster and then we fix it this way. Vitalik Buterin: There is like definitely going to   be panic and supply chain disruption \nand like all of those things in the   meantime. I mean unless it somehow comes \nin some like very small and orderly way. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Have \nyou, have you presented this   idea to, to anyone and kind of gotten \nany feedback on like whether this is,   whether this is a like possible method of \nreducing existential risk in the long term? Vitalik Buterin: Not in the context of reducing \nit existential risks but like, I mean I have   kind of talked to people about kind of moderate \nde-organization in general and there’s definitely   people that are bullish on it. Like they’re \nbasically just because you know, telecommuting   is getting better and better. Self driving \ncars could eventually turn into self driving   helicopters and even just drone helicopters and \nlike Uber Eats and using all of those things can   easily make like living 45 kilometers away \nfrom a city center much more tolerable than   it used to be. Another interesting thing is self \ndriving buses as a medium density transportation   solution. When I was at the radical exchange \nconference in Detroit, I talked to a guy from,   from the Boston government about this and he \nwas really bullish on them. So the interesting   thing also with driving buses is that they \nare like first of all very low infrastructure. Vitalik Buterin: Like you don’t \nhave to build the tracks and all   these other things. But also right now, \n60% of the cost of a bus is the driver. Robert Wiblin: Wow. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. So if you get rid \nof the driver, like suddenly becomes a way   more affordable and also you keep, once you \nhave no driver, then it becomes economical to   split up the buses in half. So they’re twice as \nfrequent. And then you can talk about dedicated   lanes for them. You can also talk about like \nthe IT infrastructures. So you hook them up to   the traffic of lights, make sure they always get \npriority, and then we start thinking about buses   being like almost as good as subways and then this \nbecomes something you can roll out in like a city   of pretty much any population level. So yeah. And \nthat’s, there’s definitely, these are these sort   of trends of different kinds that do make it \nseem like it’s possible. The kind of high density   metropolis as like basically at its peak right \nnow and will even start tapering off slightly. Robert Wiblin: Interesting. Interesting \ndiversion there. I’ll have to look more   into that one. So for me as someone who’s, \nyeah, particularly interested in the long-term   future of humanity and is concerned about \nexistential risks in particular, are there,   are there any ways that kind of \ncrypto economics, or blockchain,   or these coordination mechanisms, do you feel \nlike that they have much leverage in terms of,   you know, putting humanity on a better trajectory \nor changing the long term future? And I guess   if you’re imagining someone who’s kind of \nchoosing between working on like AI safety   research versus you know or going into blockchain \nrelated research, which which one do you think   would probably be better for someone who is \ntrying to make a difference to the long term? Vitalik Buterin: Realistically I think like \nboth of those areas are really valuable and   it does end up depending on kind of what your \nspecialty is and where your interests are.   I mean blockchains are definitely kind of \nin the, in the near term there is all this   potential for building coordination mechanisms \non top of them and making global markets more   efficient and like improving security of a \nwhole bunch of different things and all these   other benefits. But then like all of that doesn’t \nmatter if the world gets blown up by an AI, so… Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I definitely \nthink they’re both important. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Are there \nany applications or like possible   applications of any of that research for \nimproving the long term feature that we   haven’t already covered that might \nbe worth highlighting or like any,   any aspects of it that you think are particularly \nleveraged in terms of the long term impact? Vitalik Buterin: So here is an interesting and \nkind of a long term flavored one. So let’s suppose   that there is some public good that exists and \npeople can start contributing to building now,   but it’s a thing that’s not really recognized well \nas a public good today, but you think it’s going   to be something that’s universally agreed to be \na really important public good 20 years or 50   years from now. Right. So like something that’s \nkind of at the, at the end stages today might be   like ending slavery which is something that’s at \nthe end. Something which is in the earlier stages   today might be contributing to carbon emissions \nreduction and or even just AI research itself.   So basically coming up with mechanisms to \ntry to encourage people to contribute to   those public goods today. And so the general \nkind of patterns here is that you can create   tokens that basically corresponds to the proof \nthat you actually participated in this public   good project today. So carbon credits would be one \nexample here and you can start markets for these   things today and you can make these markets \nwork like having them be really efficient,   have them be international, and anyone in the \nworld can participate in all these nice things. Vitalik Buterin: And then you just assume \nthat like the world is going to be more well   coordinated 50 years from now, and are actually \ngoing to care about like buying up these tokens   because they will represent either something like, \nin the case of carbon credits scheme, there’s the   rights to make a certain level of emissions \nor it could just be something that kinds of   enlightens like functional decision theory. \ngovernments of the future just ended up buying   up to kind of thank people who helped in the \npast and to maintain the commandments that   these kinds of tokens are going to be valuable \nfor things that matter in the future. So yeah,   that’s like an interesting kind of \nthing you could build on at large. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, I think, I don’t know, \nsomeone else who’s been on the show actually I   think has had almost exactly this idea and calls \nthem impact bonds. Do you know Paul Christiano? Vitalik Buterin: No. Robert Wiblin: Oh, sorry. Impact certificates I \nthink. Yeah, no, I think it sounded like almost   exactly the same concept where it’s kind of \na nonprofit like 80,000 Hours would… Would   like claim to have accomplished particular things \nand then kind of sell the impact in exchange for   like a revenue which would be kind of donations \nof a sort and then people would then there’d be   a secondary market on these impacts that we’ve \nhad. And then if people in the future think that   the impact we had was like of more value than \npeople thought in the past and you can turn a   profit by like buying it and then selling it \nlater. It’s a very quirky idea, but I guess,   yeah, inasmuch as you could really get people \nto kind of be convinced that these things   have value in proportion to like how good the \nactions were then it seems like it could be   like a different and like potentially in some \nways more efficient way of funding nonprofits. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. Like there’s definitely \na lot of these really interesting things   that you can do when you combine these \ndifferent mechanism design ideas together,   you can be combining the prediction markets and \npublic good funding gadgets or combining together   like assurance contracts and quadratic funding \nprediction markets can be combined together   with pretty much anything. Yeah. There’s \ndefinitely a lot of unexplored territory. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. You mentioned \nfunctional decision theory, but how   much do you follow the kind of debates on \nthe philosophy of decision theory and kind   of these heterodox decision theories? I \nthink, forgive me listeners if you don’t,   if you don’t know what that is, I’m not going \nto try to explain it. It’s too complicated, but… Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I know what they \nare. I think it’s definitely a really just   philosophically interesting branch of research \nand my friend, Jeff Coleman from Toronto was   like a huge fan of like thinking about these \nthings. I mean I definitely on the other hand,   like don’t spend every day thinking about them I \nguess. Yeah. And there’s definitely people that   kind of seem to attach sort of magical properties \nto these things that I don’t think they actually   have. Like I definitely don’t really subscribe \nto the idea that kind of public goods problems   for example, would just magically go away if \npeople just have the right mindset that they   actually have the incentive to get into \ntoday. Like generally people that do kind   of stretch it into making that kind of claim, and \nI don’t think they’re correct on that. But yeah,   and at the same time, there’s definitely kind \nof interesting things to learn from there. And   I even at one point I wrote a post kind of talking \nabout how it could be… This could be the sort of   thing that smart contracts are useful for because \nkind of organizations like DAOs basically commit   to having internal kind of governance logic \nthat favors certain kinds of things and you   can make certain kinds of contracts off \nof that that you couldn’t do otherwise. Robert Wiblin: That’s, that’s really interesting. \nI’ll stick up some links to a description of the   issues of decision theory for listeners \nwho want to kind of pull on that thread. Effective altruism\nRobert Wiblin: Let’s talk about   effective altruism for a little bit. What \ndo you like about effective altruism as   a philosophy or a community, if you’ve \ninteracted with it and maybe like what   would be your biggest critiques \nor areas you’d like to improve? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. And the thing that I \nlike about effective altruism is that just   that it seems to solve this really important \nniche of being kind of altruistic and caring   about problems that go beyond kind of yourself and \nyour own tribe, but also being like effective in   caring about problems that actually matter. Like \nthere’s definitely this criticism that I hear   about how a lot of these kinds of do-gooder people \nand organizations just because there aren’t any   kind of incentives involved. Like you just end up \ndoing things in ways that are really inefficient.   Like either in terms of how they do it or because \nthey just focus on problems that matter a lot less   than other problems they could be focusing \non. And it’s great that there is a movement   that’s kind of very explicitly focusing on like, \n“Hey, let’s not fall into that failure mode.” Vitalik Buterin: And it’s also great that \nit’s a movement that’s managed to kind of   sell charity as something cool to computer \ngeeks. Yeah. And that’s something that does,   I think really valuable. And it’s definitely \nsomething that I kind of try to just promote as   well. Yeah. So just what the movement is and what \nit stands for I think is kind of fundamentally a   great thing. In terms of weaknesses, I think you \nknow, one is that it’s like it’s definitely had a   lot of success at kind of reaching out within \nthe kind of Silicon Valley tech community,   but it hasn’t yet had much success and \nreaching out to kind of international like   wealthy people and international communities \nin general and communities other than the   tech community and just basically anything \nthat’s kind of further from San Francisco. Vitalik Buterin: Another one is that effective \naltruism I think still hasn’t figured out like   as a community what its relationship is to kind of \npolitical action. Like for a lot of people, that   usual kind of approach is that “Hey, if you want \nto do good, like you should do it by going out and   protesting and campaigning for things.” The theory \nbasically being that like you like you could just   leverage your money but it’s much more efficient \nif you could basically apply pressure to leverage   like these existing really huge sources of money \nand influence that exists and kind of pushing   them toward causes that you think are valuable. \nBut then there is the criticism of that which is   that a lot of those activities are zero sum. And \nso like if there is a lot of people doing this and   they’re just pushing their own biases, then, are \nthey actually contributing anything good to the   world sort of on net? And there is this kind of \ninterplay between those two different arguments. Vitalik Buterin: And I mean the rationalist \nkind of community definitely doesn’t really   do much kind of political action yet. \nAnd like people definitely do like go   all up sometimes going and say like, “Yeah you \nopen borders” and like a couple of these other   sort of somewhat EA flavored political areas. But \nlike generally it does seem to be sort of limited.   And it seems like there’s some extent that not \ngoing into political action is deliberate. And   like I do see a lot of benefits from that, but I \njust think something this space could do more on. Robert Wiblin: I think. Yeah, you might be happy \nto know that I think that outside of the Bay   area or like, the effective altruism community \nin kind of Australia or continental Europe or   the UK is significantly less techie. Like I’m \nnot particularly techie and I guess 80,000   hours only partially is, and I guess we kind of \nencourage people to go into policy careers quite   a lot. We’ve had like a lot of episodes on what \ngovernment policies we would like to see changed   and what kind of careers can you pursue. But \nit’s definitely true that, I mean the Bay area,   the San Francisco Bay area is like one of the \nbig centers for effective altruism and over   there there’s definitely some more skepticism \nabout policy change. And I suppose it is like   the nature of that city is to be \npretty tech heavy and to be like,   yeah. Not diverse in in the ways \nthat we might want it to be. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, that’s definitely \ngood. Yeah, and I think kind of diversifying   outreach is definitely important. \nLike just because like you need to   be where the ability to affect change is and \naffecting change happens in lots of places. Robert Wiblin: Have you ever, I mean I \nimagine the crypto community is another   group that probably like doesn’t have as much \ndiversity as it would like to have and probably   tries to do things to you know, encourage \na wider range of people to get involved.   Are there any kind of lessons you’ve learned \nfrom that potentially we could benefit from? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, man, we definitely try. \nLike we run our annual conference on a different   continent every year. We have employees in like \nyou know at least 10 different countries and like   we have really explicitly tried quite hard to go \ninto these places where not many other people have   been going so far and kind of see what’s up \nand see how we can kind of interact with and   support existing local efforts there. I think \none important kind of piece of advice that I’ve   learned is to just kind of know your limits. Like \nrealistically there are just kinds of talents that   you’re not going to find in developing countries \nmuch and because again, maybe the people that   are talented would’ve just moved to like the US \nor wherever else already so you can also just…   In many cases kind of cultures are different and \nso you’re not going to find kind of things that   you like to the same extent in all parts \nof the world. Like crypto communities in   many parts of Asia kind of are legitimately \njust more money-oriented and less idealism   oriented that I would like. And like there are \ndefinitely exceptions and we’re delighted to   work with the exceptions, but there are kind \nof the general patterns exist as well. Yeah,   and I think just like having a sort of diverse \nspace that you outreach to is important and just   going to places in person and stuff is a really \ngood way of doing that. And people sometimes   think that going to conferences is a waste of \ntime, but in many cases it’s really not. Like   conferences are not about the conference, right? \nThey’re about the people that you meet there. Robert Wiblin: So yeah, folks with an interesting \ncryptocurrency like yeah including you, have kind   of been a big source of donations for projects \nin the effective altruism community and I guess   the, the rationalists community as well. How do \nyou think we might kind of encourage like yeah,   more crypto entrepreneurs or investors to kind of \nmake large effective altruism inspired donations? Vitalik Buterin: I mean, I think just continuing \nto market the concept as you have been doing is   just great. Like I learned about effective \naltruism from somewhere. Everyone who has   learned about it, learned about it from somewhere. \nAnd it’s usually the internet and like either the   effective altruism specific websites or like \nSlate Star Codex or one of these. Yeah, I mean,   it depends because like there’s, there’s \npeople within the crypto communities,   that care about these ideas. Like including \nmyself and I definitely try to kind of promote   them where I can. And I mentioned like \nwe brought Stewart Brand to defcon last   year. I mean we brought Aubrey to edcon to talk \nabout life extension and we had workshops with   AI safety people. So we definitely you know, \ntried doing that. But then on the other hand,   like if the audience isn’t receptive to it, then \nyou’re probably not going to get much out of that.   So yeah. And I think it’s just like a matter that \nthe communities should keep talking to each other. Robert Wiblin: You’ve given quite \na lot. I’m curious to know, how do   you think about your own philanthropy \nand I guess are there any places or   causes that you would kind of encourage our \nlisteners to potentially make donations to? Vitalik Buterin: So the ones that I’ve \ngiven money to, one is the Against Malaria   Foundation. The other is GiveDirectly than \nan Aubrey is SENS life-extension stuff and   MIRI are probably the big four. And there’s \nprobably some other smaller ones. I mean I’ve,   I guess I’ve contributed to the Radical \nexchange foundation too quite a bit,   if that counts. Yeah. And I think it’s like just \na matter of agreeing, like first of all just like   deciding that these are causes that you care about \nand, and then once you do, then like wanting to   give money to these projects. And it definitely \njust came very naturally to me because like   it was just a no-brainer that there’s an \nopportunity to spend these amounts of money too- Vitalik Buterin: An opportunity to \nspend indecent amounts of money to   benefit a potentially really \nlarge group of people. Otherwise,   it definitely depends on each person. I \nmean I think just having the arguments for   why these things are good to be out there \nand continue to be expressed is important. Robert Wiblin: Is there kind of a process that \nyou go through to decide whether to donate or do   you have to make decisions fairly quickly just \ngiven all of your many other responsibilities? Vitalik Buterin: I think the biggest bottleneck \nfor me is that as more of an outsider, I have   a hard time telling whether these projects legit \nor are they just overexcited idealists that think   they’re right, but actually are absolutely not \nright for reasons that they’re not appreciating. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Vitalik Buterin: So yeah, I mean even \nthe crypto space has a lot of this,   right? There’s a lot of people that really \nwants to do good and projects that are doing   good. There’s projects that just don’t \nmake sense. And then there’s some scams   and then there’s things that are in the \nmiddle, like people who know in the back   of their minds that their project might be \ntotal junk but they keep going because hey,   they’re making a lot of money out of it. Yeah. So \nwhen I go into say, the life-extension space for   example, and I’m trying to figure out okay, \nthere are these people. Who do I donate to? Vitalik Buterin: I just have a hard time telling, \nwho is doing real serious, super valuable work and   who is a joker. And I just don’t have the internal \ncultural context in the space to be able to figure   those kinds of things out very easily. And for \neven AI risk research as well, it’s sometimes   it’s hard to tell, but then, I mean even MIRI has \nits fair share of critics. Or poverty reduction,   that’s one of those things that is a bit safer. \nBut on the other hand a lower risk, lower return. Robert Wiblin: Do you think that \nthe crypto community as a whole   is too excited or not excited enough about \nphilanthropy as a way to make a difference? Vitalik Buterin: I’d definitely \nsay not excited enough. Robert Wiblin: You think compared to the \namount of windfalls that some people have made,   they’re not excited enough about getting like \nleverage on their time by giving away that money. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, exactly. There is \ndefinitely just a lot of people that have a lot   of money and they’re either content to just sit on \nit, or they pour it into various expensive things   that aren’t going to mean that much to them. \nAnd I’m like dude, you do realize you could pump   this money in, and have the knowledge that you \npersonally were responsible for saving 250 lives? Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, that’s definitely something   that appeals to me, but maybe their \npsychology is different. I don’t know. Robert Wiblin: Did you think it is possible to \nchange the social rewards that people get in their   community to make it more… like people get more \nkudos for donations that people view as effective   and valuable rather than, I don’t know, the yacht \nor whatever people are spending their money on? Vitalik Buterin: Oh definitely. I’ve \ndefinitely tried. There’s the low tech   approach of just talking about these things \nwhich I’ve done and it’s had some impact,   but there’s also higher tech approaches that I’m \ninterested in. One thing that I tried to do is   this idea of stickers, which is basically that \nif you have these decentralized applications,   then if you donate some amount of money to some \ncharity and then you get a sticker and you can   proudly wear the sticker inside of these \ndecentralized applications and it’s on the   blockchain. So any of these applications can \nverify it, and that’s something that you can   show that you care about the cause. There is an \nplatform of Peepeth, a decentralized Twitter, that   did this for the Against Malaria Foundation and \nit seemed to work pretty well. Last time I checked   just about every Peepeth user have one of these \n$25 anti-malaria badges, which was really cool. Robert Wiblin: What’s the name of that? Sorry. Vitalik Buterin: Peepeth. P-E-E-P-E-T-H. Robert Wiblin: Nice. Okay. Yeah. Vitalik Buterin: Things like that I’m excited   about. I mean there’s also other weird ideas, so \nthis charity through marginal price discrimination   blog post that I made a couple of years ago, where \nI basically we suggested this idea that if there   are projects that are contributing to public goods \nand get publicly recognized for it. Or if there’s   people that contribute to public goods and they \ncan get publicly recognized for it and then other   projects can give them discounts. And there’s \neconomic reasoning for why giving people discounts   for doing good things is much higher leverage than \njust giving money to a project yourself. And so   that’s the sort of thing that would be interesting \nto try out more. And this is walking back into   this mechanism design territory as well. Yeah, and \nthere is social things that you can do. There’s   these mechanized design things that you can do. I \nthink the best mechanisms have both an incentive   component and a social component to them. So \nwe definitely want to see more experimentation. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, I read that blog post, \n“Charity through marginal price discrimination”,   which we’ll stick up a link to for people \nwho want to fully understand it. I guess,   yeah, the intuition is that if you’re a \nbusiness and you give a discount to some   group of people who you want to reward, then \non the one hand you lose revenue from the fact   that you’re charging less per product, but on \nthe other hand you’re compensated for by the   fact that you’ll sell more of them because \nthey’re cheaper. And so in fact it doesn’t   cost you nearly as much in terms revenue \nor profit as the benefit to the people who   are getting the discount. I guess this is an \nexample of a general phenomenon that I guess   Robin Hanson wrote a blog post about this \n10 years ago, of the effectiveness of really   incremental change. If you’re a business \njust like reduce your prices a little bit. Robert Wiblin: Really small changes in your \nbehavior on the margin cost very little   but might benefit other people a lot. So you \nget like a really big benefit to cost ratio,   though it’s not clear that the total benefit \nyou could create by making lots of these little   changes is all that large. And actually another \nguest in a recent episode, Paul Christiano,   applied this to divestment and pointed out that \ndivestment from companies on the margin costs you   practically nothing, but it actually does reduce \ntheir access to capital at least a bit compared to   that negligible cost and it’s basically just \nthe same phenomenon again. But I guess yeah,   in terms of the business giving discounts to \nparticular groups and then charging everyone else,   a little bit more, it feels like there’s \na bit of magic going on here. It’s like,   where are these extra resources coming from \nif the benefit to the recipients is larger   than the cost to the business? It seems like \nto some extent there’s a transfer from other   businesses that are losing customers, \nmaybe? Is that where it’s happening? Vitalik Buterin: In general when \nyou’re operating in any economy   that’s not really efficient there’s going \nto be these kinds of environments where,   or at least contexts where on the margin you \ncan do something that costs you one cent to   benefit someone else $1. And the reason why \nthese opportunities exist is precisely because   the economy’s not perfectly efficient. I mean so \none example of this is, if you’re an employer,   then there’s some wage at which you would want \nto pay your employees if your profit maximizing,   but then if you push your wage 5 cents higher \nthen you get both some costs and some benefits.   The costs are that you have to pay more and \nthe benefits are that you have higher retention   rates and they’re happier and less likely to \nsteal from you, and a thousand little things. Vitalik Buterin: And the reason why a profit \nmaximizing employer would not push higher is   because they only push to the point \nwhere the costs equal the benefits.   But then if you’re profit maximizing \nplus a bit altruistic, then you’d want   to push a bit higher because if all of the \ndifferent utility functions are continuous   then, the profit maximizing point versus good to \nother people is at the top of a hill. And so if   you push a bit to the right, you’re going quite \na bit to the right, but you’re only pushing your   profits down a tiny amount at first. And in \ngeneral, in not perfectly efficient economies   there just is going to be lots of these tiny \nlittle opportunities to do things like that. Vitalik Buterin: Almost every private market \ninefficiency has an associated way to leverage   that to do good at a medium extent at a \nlow cost. And so the idea behind these   price discrimination things is basically, hey, \nlet’s use that inefficiency as a leverage point,   and we try to take this ability to benefit \nsomeone else a dollar at a cost of a few cents   to yourself and we steer it in a direction of, \n“Hey, let’s use this to benefit charity projects.” Vitalik Buterin: So the really nice thing about \nthis mechanism is that it actually replicates   quadratic voting in some way. Because if \nyou look at the math, then the amount of   money that you lose by pushing your prices \nin one direction is quadratic in the extent   to which you pushed the price, because at the \nbeginning you’re only losing a few opportunities,   but the opportunities you’re losing are the ones \nthat are not that valuable in the first place. And   then it goes up and then it goes up more. So the \ncosts are quadratic. So they start off very tiny,   but the benefits are linear. So it becomes almost \naccidentally economically efficient in that way,   which is really cool. Yeah, and this is just an \nexample of the kinds of things that we could do   if you just have the ability to create more of \nthese proofs of what economic activity that you   did. And I guess this is one of the things \nthat blockchains may end up helping with. Free speech\nRobert Wiblin: Yeah. Speaking of   blog posts that you’ve written, I saw \nyou quite recently wrote this great piece   about free speech, which I thought had an \nunusually nuanced view on what exactly is   valuable about free speech and how we \nshould think about private censorship   rather than government censorship in practice. \nDo you want to lay out your argument there? Vitalik Buterin: Sure. And so the basic argument \nis that I was arguing against people that say that   free speech is purely a legal protection that \napplies only to governments and that private   entities censoring whoever they want is A-OK and \nit’s totally just their policy and we should be   neutral about it. And the main argument that \nI have there is basically that first of all,   there’s a reason why we have free speech norms \nand the reason why we have these free speech   norms most fundamentally, is that if you want \nto create an environment where good ideas win,   then you want to have an environment \nwhere you don’t have these weird kind   of side incentives that like really \nheavily penalize you for publishing   certain kinds of ideas where those incentives have \nnothing to do with the idea’s underlying goodness. Vitalik Buterin: Basically government \ncensoring is obviously one example of that,   but we’re increasingly living in a world where \nthese private entities also have a huge amount   of power over basically how we talk to each \nother and how each story gets presented. And   if a private entity ends up censoring that, then \nit in many cases ends up having a lot of the same   kinds of costs that government censorship does. \nAnd so basically we should be upset at them for   exactly the same kinds of reasons. So, yeah, \nI mean the example that I gave to start off   is this Bitcoin sub-Reddit moderator that started \ncensoring all of the pro Big Block opinions ended   up leading to the Bitcoin community splitting \nin half. And had that been managed better,   I think it could have easily led to an outcome \nthat was more harmonious in a lot of ways. Vitalik Buterin: But then, I mean I also started \ntalking about how there’s different kinds of   censorship and different kinds of things that are \nborderline between being censorship and not being   censorship. So for example, if you’re running a \nconference, then a conference is inherently not   a free speech medium because you have a limited \nnumber of slots and you have to give those slots   for someone. If you’re not getting five minutes \nof time to one person, you’re giving five minutes   of time to another person. And so you just have \nto make editorial decisions and ultimately the   people that come to a conference are coming \nbecause they want to experience the editorial   decisions made by some conference organizer. They \ndon’t want to just listen to unfiltered random   people. And so to censor someone because they \nhave ideas that are genuinely bad, then that’s   totally fine. That’s just them exercising exactly \nthe editorial judgment they should be exercising. Vitalik Buterin: Though there are things \nconferences could do that’s harmful as   well. Like if they end up banning people for \nsaying things that are completely unrelated to   anything that they’re actually talking about, \nfor example, that could end up having a really   negative consequences. And then the other example \nI gave was delisting coins from an exchange if   you think that those coins are scammy. And then \nthere’s the question of, is the exchange more   like an open market where anything goes, or is \nthe exchange more like an opinionated platform   that’s basically saying that these are the coins \nthat we want our viewers to see and hear about. Robert Wiblin: So I pretty aggressively delete \ncomments on my Facebook page that I don’t like,   and I block people on Twitter if \nI think that their responses to my   tweets are bad. Do you approve \nof that or disapprove that? Vitalik Buterin: I definitely \ntotally approve of it. Robert Wiblin: Interesting. Yeah. Vitalik Buterin: And the argument there basically \nbeing that, first of all not every space should   be an anything goes space and there is room \nfor spaces that optimize for I guess certain   kinds of discussion, because people want the \nability to productively discuss certain kinds   of things. And there’s definitely posts that \njust don’t add anything and really detract from   the quality of the discussion. And I think those \nare definitely, totally fine to remove. Like in   the Ethereum Reddit, moderation is very liberal. \nBut for the Ethereum research forum we do censor   nontechnical things pretty heavily. The idea \nthere is that like, “Hey this is specifically   a research space and that’s the purpose of this \nspace and the purpose of this space isn’t those   other things. And we have these other spaces for \nthose other things.” So I think spaces that are   opinionated that argue a particular objective \nis something that’s totally fine to have. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. I guess my reasoning \nis the time and attention of my readers is   a scarce resource and I don’t want to waste \nit with things that I think aren’t valuable.   Though I suppose people might object, well you \njust like preventing criticism of the things   that you’re writing and maybe you have \nbad judgment about what’s valuable and   what’s not. But then I’m like well, maybe they \nshould just go read someone else’s posts. Yeah,   I mean the standard objection is that, it’s not \na problem if like people strongly moderate the   Ethereum Reddit because people could just go to \na different Reddit group if they don’t like the   moderation on that one. Yeah. Why do you \nthink that’s not a good objection then? Vitalik Buterin: Basically because there is a kind \nof sense in which the Ethereum Reddit has a kind   of natural monopoly to it. It is Reddit to discuss \nEthereum, it’s got the name, it’s got those   network of facts that was built up people, many \nof whom were explicitly expecting a commitment   to free speech. So those sorts of things add \ntogether and I think make the Ethereum Reddit   into something that’s more like a public \nspace. Whereas if I made a Reddit called   like r/Vitaliks Forum and I explained these are \nthings that I think this forum should be discussed   and I censored it heavily, I think like much \nfewer people would end up having a problem with   that. There’s definitely value in private spaces. \nThere’s definitely value in public spaces as well. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, I think that’s a maybe a \ndistinction that I hadn’t really thought about   as much before that, if you create the Effective \nAltruism Reddit and it’s actually called the   Effective Altruism Reddit, to some extent, you’ve \ntaken a scarce public resource away, which is   the name that gives this sense of legitimacy \nin people’s minds and that maybe gives you   responsibilities that you wouldn’t have if it was \njust ‘Rob’s effective altruism’ discussion. Yeah,   I think it helps to explain why people \nsometimes object to more intense moderation   in some circumstances but then they’re \ntotally fine with it and other cases. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. Robert Wiblin: So I’ll stick up a link to that \nblog post. I think it’s a well worth potentially   having a read. I suppose just a slightly \nprovocative question out of left field,   is that big thrust of your work is encouraging \ndecentralization and empowering individuals.   I’m the kind of person who has a positive \nsense about decentralization in general and   likes markets and like people be able to speak \ntheir mind and just say whatever they think.   What do you think are the chances that there’s \nlike something like fundamentally wrong about   that worldview and that, for example, people are \njust bad and just empowering people more broadly   and decentralizing authority is harmful, and that \nmaybe really the only way things can work if you   just luck out and have some centralized authority \nand hope that you got the right people in charge? Vitalik Buterin: Yeah, I think those kinds of \ncritiques are definitely worth worrying about. I   mean, there’s one kind of aspect of the critique \nthat I mentioned already, which is this public   good issue about having correct opinions. And then \nthere’s inequalities in the level of expertise,   and there’s the issue of “will we make these \nmechanisms that have this kind of egalitarian   flavor to them?”. But there’s also this lingering \nquestion, “do we want to kind of try harder to   come up with mechanisms that explicitly try \nto, kind of target opinions that will look   like expert opinions, or correct opinions more \nthan just aggregating the average?”. And I mean,   there’s obviously downsides to technocracy, but on \nthe other hand, these things are definitely worth   really taking seriously. So it’s definitely \nsomething that we’re actively thinking about. Robert Wiblin: One thing I didn’t ask earlier \nis, for people who want to get involved in this   whole incentive design and mechanism design, \ncrypto economic space, what would be some good   first steps for them? What people might they be \ntalking to or what websites should they visit? Vitalik Buterin: I guess it depends on what \nyour interest in crypto is. Are you interested   in being a researcher, being a developer or being \na user, just holding and doing things with coins,   participating in quadratic votes, being an \nenthusiast? Visiting a meet up I think is   good because it also gets you in touch with the \nlocal community. Tryethereum.today is a pretty   good website that directly pushes you to the \nbasics in terms of actually using the platform.   On the research side, I mean there’s ethresear.ch \nand then the different threads on it and that’s a   kind of research forum that is pretty accessible \nfor people to start contributing fairly quickly.   Hackathons and participating in hackathons \nis often a way a lot of people get started. Robert Wiblin: Yeah, I guess \nthere’s the radical exchange   meetups and the radical exchange conference. Vitalik Buterin: Yeah. So on the radical exchange \nside, I think the meetups and often … I’ve noticed   in a lot of cases they tend to be sistered with \ncrypto meetups in different cases, in a sense,   because they’re technically two \ndifferent sets of ideas, but there is   a lot of ways to use one to implement the other \nand a lot of people who care about one care about   the other. Yeah. So meetups, and otherwise online \nmaterials. Yeah. It just depends on what kind of   person you are and what aspects of both of \nthose spaces you want to be interested in. Recommendations\nRobert Wiblin: Yeah. Fantastic.   Yeah. On an even lighter note, I recently \npublished this blog post where I recommended   27 products that I use and suggest that other \npeople might want to use and buy themselves.   You mentioned that you had a reaction to one \nof them. I think, was it the air miles one? Vitalik Buterin: I’ve ended up acquiring just a \nbunch of different optimization techniques over   the course of my six years of traveling way too \nmuch. In terms of like specific things … I liked   the donut, so I mean I noticed that you had \na power adapter that’s one of those universal   twelve dollar ones. The donut is … the company? \nI think it’s called Mogics, M-O-G-I-C-S, and   it’s a bit more expensive, but the nice \nthing about it is that it also functions   as a kind of multi-way splitter, so you \ncan plug in a lot of different cables. Vitalik Buterin: So if you’re traveling \nwith friends, if one person has them,   you can just plug everything in. So that’s \nreally nice. In terms of bags, I travel with   a 40 litre bag which seems exactly the right \nsize, like it’s still big enough to carry stuff,   but it’s small enough that you have no problem \nputting it into carry on, and even walking long   distances with it. Yeah. And otherwise, I’ve got \na laptop bag. Inside of my laptop bag, I also have   a bunch of tea bags so I can have tea wherever \nI want, so a bunch of little things like that. Robert Wiblin: Nice. All right, I’ll get links \nfrom you for all of those products if people want   to travel the Vitalik way. I feel like I have \nto travel all the time, which is why I put up   a bunch of different travel recommendations or \nthings I use that I think makes it a little bit   less painful, but I’m sure the amount of flying I \ndo is nothing on what you have to suffer through. Vitalik Buterin: It’s both challenging \nand rewarding in a lot of places,   to just be able to visit different people and \nhave friends in all these different places. Robert Wiblin: Yeah. Well thanks for everything \nyou’re doing to try to develop Ethereum,   develop blockchain technology. I think \nyou have a fantastic mentality towards   all this and given everything that you’ve \naccomplished so early, you’re also just   impressively humble and impressively candid, \nand I really appreciate that you’re so direct   and candid that I can kind of just take \nthe things you say as trustworthy and your   honest impression of how things are. \nI feel like there’s no spin with you. Vitalik Buterin: I mean, I definitely try. Robert Wiblin: My guest today has been Vitalik   Buterin. Thanks for coming \non the podcast, Vitalik. Vitalik Buterin: Thanks. It \nwas really good to be here. Robert Wiblin: As always there’s lots of links   to go and learn more in the show \nnotes and associated blog post. And the natural next episode to \nlisten to, if you haven’t already,   is #52 — Prof Glen Weyl on uprooting \ncapitalism and democracy for a just society. The 80,000 Hours Podcast is \nproduced by Keiran Harris. Thanks for joining, talk to you in a week or two.",

    "title": "Interview EXCLUSIVE de Vitalik Buterin 🤔 ETH, IA, Ordinateurs quantiques, Poutine, Trump, L2 et +",
    "content": "the question now is basically you know can uh Bitcoin sort of catch up and uh get to what I call the functionality escape velocity in my post about 5 years ago right like having enough functionality that L2 is on top of it can do everything I think you met Vladimir Putin a couple of times and also other leaders uh what are their thoughts on eum in the ecosystem maybe you have some insights to share about it like if ethereum gets super concentrated in like a one single ETF or a few single F like that's definitely a big risk I think that like having more Diversified staking is definitely super valuable and I think we should try to promote it as much as we can you don't think that like United States or Russia will like uh buy Bitcoin or buy Eve and get like a strategic Reserve like this is something that you bearish on so first like on the quantum stuff in general right so the basic like way in which this will affect us is that quantum computers they break elliptic growth cryptography but not hashes right so they break about half of the cryptography that ethereum depends on what do you like the most and hate the most about Bitcoin and ethereum how is it doing yeah very good happy to be here thank you very much for accepting this interview I'm very glad um to be honest it's been one of my dream to do that so um thank you for that uh so maybe to to start uh I was just just wondering like how has your life been like lately like for the past two three years like how were you personally what were you doing like how is life doing for you um okay so I think uh since Co I've been trying to like travel less than I have been before like still quite a bit but before Co I was on average doing about like one trip a month or one trip a week um two times less than that I've been focusing on like a combination of things uh so some still a lot of ethereum research and ethereum development discussions so like recently yeah the chain specific address topic has been starting to be big so I was like heavily involved in like talking to different people organizing trying to set the direction on that um you know research topic around all of the topics that I wrote about know blobs roof of Stak scaling I think the percentage of my time I spend on that is definitely still like less than before like back in 2018 like I was still almost the only researcher in ethereum and now of course we have such a big and amazing team and Justin has been stepping up a lot recently M barnab Franchesco a Hu a huge number of uh amazing people recently and like it's entire teams of them now right so still continuing to write the blog posts um so the recent big one that I wrote was you know like all of those on the ethereum protocol and I think like my goal there was basically to try to like make the knowledge of like where the discussions are and what kinds of things people are thinking about how people see the tradeoffs what what goals people have more accessible to try to make it possible for more people to participate in that space um also um continuing to just meet and talk to different ethereum communities um also starting to focus more on the application side like maybe this year and last year I think up until like maybe one year ago it was difficult to do things on the application side in like a very practical way because like you can talk about ideas right and I've been writing blog posts about ideas like you know even like futarchy back in 2015 uh but when the blockchain is difficult to use not scalable like you have all those problems it's uh still difficult to actually get anything past the idea stage into a large scale adoption stage but now of course 2024 layer 2s are extremely cheap uh we have uh all of these improvements in transaction fees usability transaction confirmation wallet security that like it feels like it's actually possible to really not just talk about the application side but really build it so like that was also part of why I wrote that recent piece on info finance and know piece on wallets so starting to think much more about that um public goods funding also another topic so definitely spend a lot of time like thinking about those kinds of different ideas um also like I I try to stay in the trenches on the programming uh so I yeah this year wrote the like implementation of circle Starks um using you know GPU and Cuda um so it was uh good for me to like that was really helpful for me to learn like both the math behind Circle Starks and how to do GPU programming that was like the first time I ever actually properly did GPU programming like learning new things is like maybe like three or four times easier now that you have ai helping so I feel like it's you know the Golden Age of getting new skills in a lot of ways um and then also like actually yeah playing around with AIS and local models myself I uh you don't know if you saw that the bull post I made on Twitter a few days ago but every one of those B posts made you know ethereum aligned a the AI is open source so you know no not not calling to proprietary apis in there um it's you been have you been trying have you been using like decentralized models like or like I would say um um things that were outside we've seen like Bens for exle releasing new stuff and and having like an open source approach and a public approach like is it something you've been uh checking or looking at yeah and so I talked to the biter people I actually yeah visited one of their meetups in Singapore earlier this year um I think uh my Theory with like decentralized AI right now is that the best decentralized AI is AI that just runs on your device it's uh like you know in our ecosystem we sometimes have this tendency where we try to make things complicated and like stick things on blockchains and add tokens uh but often the kind of decentralization that you need is like actually less making things dependent on um you know like any kind of complicated remote stuff so you know I have uh all kinds of models just running locally on GBU and that just uh works great for a lot of my personal uses um yeah and I know there's been interesting work around like distributed training that's uh and I saw there was that recent release of a pretty significant model being trained in a fully distributed way and I think that stuff's definitely amazing I'm kind of watching from the from the sidelines like it feels like it's still you know a step or two away from being mature enough but definitely yeah you know really cool when it happens okay and um I was wondering like what are you doing outside of crypto um are you trying new stuff are you trying to educate yourself like uh about like new topics you mentioned AI is there any other topics outside AI or maybe even outside of crypto you know because people knows you as like the crypto guy from ethereum but what are you doing outside yeah so about a year ago I wrote this big post that was called my techno optimism right and one of the goals there was to try to like basically have a a much broader like philosophy of technology and what kinds of Technologies are valuable to build and especially if uh you know you care like I think a lot of crypto people care about creating a world where the world you know doesn't blow blow up and at the same time in the world that doesn't get you know taken over by a small number of very centralized actors and like crypto is obviously part of that but crypto is like only one part of that right and I think it's like it's always valuable for us to like update our stories and uh you know keep in mind like what's going on with the outside world and you know stay connected and adapted to it right you know the original ideas in Bitcoin and there was that those in the blog post right January 3rd 2009 Chancellor on bring of second bailout for banks right and yeah you know that was really what animated the digital gold concept but you know that's one of the things that we worry about but then there's also all of these other concerns around you know like social media like I think everyone people have different stories in their heads about why social media in 2024 is broken but I think everyone definitely has a yes story of why it's broken and like decentralized social media could actually be part of the solution and then I've also banar very bullish on community notes I'm also prediction markets know following poly Market pretty closely even now participating on it quite a bit also on biotech so if you remember in 2021 there were the uh uh this was the time when the do coins were getting very big right so shu marss to and gave the coins uh the Sha Inu coins right one part to the future of Life Institute and one part to India crypto relief and at the time like I was basically thinking very quickly right and like my mind was just thinking okay these coins they went up to like a billion dollars in one week therefore they're going to crash down to like10 million the next week and like to do something useful with them like now like very fast right and so I just like basically yeah sent them out to different charities and I was expecting they would get like maybe like1 million out of them but of course it ended up being you know much crazier than that like I did not expect this at all but those coins kept their value and uh both crypto relief and future of Life were able to each individually cash out more than $400 million and uh so out of that like that ended up being too much for crypto relief to spend and it uh and even the future of Life Institute that's definitely having a hard time spending that like that large an amount so myself and some like bio advisers I've known for a long time started this group called BV which is basically trying to support um basically open-source uh bio defense and like bios safety work so things that can make us safer against know future pandemics but without doing the thing where we like lock people in in their houses and like stop everyone from traveling for two years uh so there's a lot of really interesting stuff that came out of that and a lot of that actually yeah it's like the research is like actually very connected to uh even research that people care about for things like BCI and Longevity right so for like longevity for example right I mean you might have heard this like off the corner of your eye this was news in the internet that basically the way that we thought about Alzheimer's for 20 years can has basically turned out to be completely fake right the like there's a lot of these newer ideas about what causes Alzheimer's and a lot of them actually focus on viral persistence so like viruses staying in your body for a long time in reservoirs where they're just difficult for your immune system to even find and this is the exact same kind of stuff that people who study long are worried about right so it's like all very connected right and like BCI is the same thing right so one of the things that balie put money into is uh Mary L jepson's Open Water um and she is someone who's like basically been ping ponging back and forth between like basically Healthcare technology and uh like doing VR for like Silicon valy yet tech companies and the reason why they're connected right is that if you can like look inside your body then you know you can read your you know brain and like you can make much very powerful interfaces and you know there's a spectrum there's like ey tracking there's the stuff that you know their goggles are doing um and at the same time uh there's like that exact same stuff is useful for like finding medical conditions way earlier than you otherwise could and in a way that's like much lower cost and much lower infrastructure right so it's like much more accessible to people and you don't and well I mean you know France you have public Healthcare but you know in America bankrupt um so that's uh like so basically yeah there's a lot of these connections between a lot of these different branches of technology and it's like a significant part of it actually is crypto but there's also this big part that like really stretches Beyond crypto and uh so in Devcon right we had this diac day on the uh third day I think the 14th right where we basically just had speakers talk about the whole range of all those Technologies and uh and the you know like how the who like who's working on them like how they're being built and even how they can be connected to each other and it's all the same theme right and you know the theme is basically that you know we should have a technology that can both keep help uh help Humanity progress and really get to the next stage get all of the amazing things that we want in a 21st century at the same time do that in a way that minimizes risk and in a way that's like defensive instead of offensive and in a way that you know like minimizes and prevents concentration of power and like that combination of themes right is a combination of themes that I think really appeals to people right and yeah like even like far like Beyond crypto right I think a lot of people they feel stuck between like one side which is being like anti yet anti- technology and anti-growth and basically saying you know the solution to our problems is that we should go back to like living in cottages and not consume energy and then on the other side is uh this like vision of Technology that's being pushed by you know a a few very powerful corporations and powerful and authoritarian governments where you know we get amazing flashy things but at the same time it's like very strange people that we totally don't understand I like end up getting back door control into our societies and our lives and really wanting to avoid both right so I think basically there is this bigger story that crypto is part of but crypto is only one uh one part of and I've been um also trying to talk about the other parts of that story and really help up help put that together um so those like those are also things I've been like researching doing funding thinking a lot over the last year as well but when now you're resting and like have you ever thought about retiring at some points uh especially from eum because this is such an important commitment along your life you know uh especially on the ethereum front so what are your thoughts about that like do you think about like retiring one day or is it like a lifetime commitment so the thing that I've I discovered about myself like psychologically is that feeling tired of work is actually not about work right and so what I mean by this is so in defon on actually the day before defon I I broke a personal record for the number of events that I did in one day I did right like literally yeah know like start got got out of the hotel at like 8 AM came back at 10:30 p.m and the whole thing was this uh very crazy orchestrated thing where you know we had myself the local thae driver and bodyguard we had yamy you know ethereum Foundation person of heroically coordinating everyone and a couple of instances I had to like just personally you know check Google Maps realize okay this thing is too far away there's too much traffic let's just like like get out and just run and take the subway and actually yeah you know the team obliged and like it was just this crazy intense day but I noticed that I felt great and basically like I think yeah like it's exertion is not about exertion and actually the days when I feel like most discouraged and the feels and the days when I feel like I wants to retire or like basically yeah actually if I spent too much time being on crypto Twitter and I basically see people saying things like Oh ethereum by caring about idealistic things and improving the world is out of touch with reality ethereum Foundation people need to get with the program and understands that they're serving a community that just wants to make money and get high yields everywhere and uh like when I hear that like honestly that's when I uh feel closest to wanting to retire um and like being a bit disappointed and frustrated at some points disappointed and like basically yeah thinking okay yeah like if like the goal of blockchains is now is just being a casino then like that's not even a thing that I yeah would feel excited about being part of uh but then the interesting thing is right that when like the last time I felt this way right after that I had a series of conversations with with people within the ethereum community and talking to people in person and talking to people in like you don't hear that yeah people who love ethereum who are excited about ethereum um who are excited about you know the financial applications and the non-financial applications who really wants to try to use all of these tools that we have to make the world better um and like people are excited and and energized you know in the market right so yeah you know too much of the wrong kind of Internet is definitely yeah you know very bad for mental health and uh it's you know always good to go outside and talk to the people outside too um yeah I yeah so I guess I don't see myself retiring I I mean I definitely have like changed my focus quite a bit over the last 10 years right like back in 2014 I was researching and I did about half the work of writing the original ethereum one of the ethereum clients which was in Python um and also doing a lot of like Foundation leg work um even like manually sending transactions to pay people that's a responsibility that I had for surprisingly long period of time um that's crazy but now now we are well more staffed so you can delegate these kind of things to people that are maybe better at this at this stuff yes right exactly and now like I've been you know think um a lot more about application layer things I think like one of the reasons why there is because like I've been thinking about this topic like basically you know like why there is this sentiment that like we should just like give up and accept that we're that we're a casino and be a good casino and I think basically a big part of that actually just is that there aren't like strong compelling positive stories that are strong enough and that are like attracting enough people's attention and I think the problem there is like for a very long time we had these like very abstract um story um stories on the application layer right and like well there was a combination of things right I think there is a lot of like what Peter Teal calls indefinite optimism which is like oh you know we're going to make the market more open and free and efficient and the point is that we don't know because we just we're empowering humanity and Humanity always makes things that are amazing therefore the future will be amazing and like Peter teal is like actually very critical of the indefinite Optimist attitude and like I think I've come to appreciate that argument over time right because like at some point you have to like actually have the specific Vision right like if everyone just says oh you know Society will figure it out or the market will figure it out then like there's no one left to actually figure it out um and uh that so that's like one part of the stories that we had and the other part of the stories that we had were like you know decentralized Uber right and like payments and things that were like kind of there were specific stories but we didn't really have the tools to deliver on those specific stories and thinking about the situation right now right um basically yeah I think there's a there have been like these missing like very specific like very definite Optimist uh stories of what this Bas is up to on the application layer and I think the thing that I perceived is I perceived this kind of split between two different sides right where one side basically says our story is things that are very idealistic things that could be beautiful and improve humanity and solve social problems but they have no way of making money and because they have no way of making money like they're not going to get anywhere right and like that's something that we do need to really respect as like a first class problem like we can't just say you know people are about the funding or the business model or like exactly funding business model and like hiring developers right and like this was a problem even before crypto right like when back when I was growing up know as a teenager I remember at diaspora this was like one of these very early Facebook Alternatives right and it was one decentralized social media before we had blockchains and one of the big reasons why they failed was like they just got a tiny amount of money and it was just not obvious what kind of business model they would and like the attraction about crypto is supposed to be that you know it is still something that's fundamentally very open source and very free and all about removing centralized parties but there are more options for a business model right but in terms of like the stories that we've seen like one part is very idealistic stories that just have no way of making money or even no way of like expanding Beyond a user base that's like very basically idealistic nerds and then the other story is like let's give up on all of that stuff and let's just build the casino right and like there's been these like two extremes and uh like I think the things that are more likely to be successful are like the balance between the extremes right and uh like this is part of why I'm excited about like poly market right it's like as I wrote in my post don't you think sorry to interrupt you but don't you think that maybe web to people have something to to bring to us because they are not thinking the same way I mean some of them are thinking the casino way you know but some of them are building legit business and and might bring like fresh IDs and and things that are more like the the way you're thinking I yeah I absolutely agree um I think like the reason one of the reasons why I think like the casino stuff has dominated is because like just transaction fees right like if you have to pay 25 cents every time you click a mouse button then like anything that's not some kind Financial thing is going to fail but like Financial things could still be viable and now I think like the question is basically yeah you know like what are the domains where crypto like actually gives you a 10x right and like there are domains where crypto gives you like a 1.1x uh but you know the financial side is definitely like the place where crypto gives you a 10x right there's definitely nonfinancial obligations that are super valuable like I've been a fan of uh you know like identity reputation even just like on putting hashes of data on chain for verification um but I mean I think there have been good applications that like kind of sit on that edge I mean ens was also a good example right like ens yeah most people who interact with ens they interact with ens nonf financially right it's just domain names you update it like you know you every if you've ever you know read anything in my blog you know. limo that's a forwarder for my ens uh but at the same time like you buy domain names right and there's a dow and you pay fees and like applications that like sit on that edge and at the same time applications that like actually solve the kinds of problems that ethereum people care about solving like I think those are the kinds of stories that we need to make stronger and so like those are some of the things that I've been thinking about too I was wondering um since you're like an early ad adopter of Bitcoin then you get you get paid in Bitcoins like a long time ago by Bitcoin magazine uh and you you dig into it and everything like why did you not continue to work on on bitcoin um like is there a world in which like Bitcoin gets better and better gets uh op stack implemented and maybe compete with ethereum on some sides you know so why did you stop working on bitcoin and is there a world in which like Bitcoin could get better than ethereum or like could compete in some ways yeah okay so so when I uh started doing ethereum right so the way uh what happened was first I was working on colored coins and master coin and uh basically those were the projects that were at the time being called Bitcoin 2.0 covered coins is like basically issuing your own assets like think of it as like basically in modern terms it's like a sovereign rollup on top of Bitcoin that only supports rc20 like that's how like you would describe it to a modern developer right but it's like and then Master coin is like that but for like more complicated Financial things and uh I was starting to work on these projects and then eventually the thing that I started doing was uh figuring out places where I could find like sets of two or three features and then replace them with one feature that combines their functionality and is even more powerful and I did this for like a few rounds and then eventually I realized that the end game is to replace their entire protocol with a programming language and so I suggested this to them they said well we'll get to it in a year I said well I'm not willing to wait a year and so I right uh so then it was the right decision I guess so okay so now the earliest versions of ethereum were actually meant to be Sovereign rollups on top of prime coin now then the question is why Prime coin this like weird other proof of work currency that was based on like climbing prime number sequences right instead of Bitcoin and the answer is that at the time Bitcoin people there there was one of these uh mini civil wars that was like probably a precursor to the big Civil War but the topic here was that the big big parts of the Bitcoin Community were very against mastercoin and they basically said these are not legitimate usages of our chain and there were people that were even pushing for reducing the op return limit like basically the limit to like basically yeah was like bitcoin's version of blobs except they were very tiny from 80 bytes to 40 Byes and the was to try Bally kind things like masterin and make them L viable and so I well if the base chain Community is going to be hostile to things like what I want to do why should I even build on bitcoin like I should just support another coin that actually welcomes this stuff and then the switch from being on Prime coin to being a separate chain basically happens when ethereum just like blew up to being hundred times bigger than I ever thought it would be and at that point I realized like we actually have enough developers to make it a change and so I realized okay fine let's just make it an independent thing right so that was the origin story I think uh the question now is basically you know can Bitcoin sort of catch up and uh get to what I call the functionality escape velocity in my post about five years ago right like having enough functionality that L2 is on top of it can do everything um so I think so first of all right there's like a bunch of these proposals like opcat is one of them right and there's like a few others that extend Bitcoin scripting capabilities by enough that you actually can get uh you know what I call State like rich statefulness and uh that also get you the ability to do things like verifying proof Sun chain right and so there definitely are upgrades that they can do to like solve that side of things and like actually make proper l2s possible like proper l2s meaning like actually trustful Soul toos right not like liquid where liquid is a like it basically is just a multi and so they can get to that um the one obstacle that they would have is that an L2 cannot give users Security on a faster timeline than the underlying chain right so the underlying chain average block time is 10 minutes sometimes it's 5 minutes sometimes it's like 30 minutes it's a bon distribution um and any of these ler 2os like they can't give you that level of security on time scales faster than Bitcoin itself and with ethereum like the swad time is 12 seconds and so ethereum does have that Advantage right and then also of course there's the differences between proof of work and proof of stake and the fact that like it's still one of those very unknown things whether or not proof of work even can provide enough security just based on transaction fees right and uh like this really has not been tried before and I think you know we've seen ethereum right like we had very high transaction fees in 20122 and then we had very low transaction fees in most of 2024 and now they're starting to pick back up again and so like transaction fees are this very volatile thing right and so like that's one of those big unknowns um and the other one of course is just I you know the politics like do Bitcoin people actually yeah want this right and you know if they were United behind wanting op cat it would have already happened right so it's uh like essentially quite pessimistic for now yeah I mean for now pessimistic and then yeah exactly and then technologically speaking I think there definitely differences like there's still like some distance between what Bitcoin can offer even if like if it wants to and like what e ethereum can offer but I mean the possibility exists and is the current state of larus what you envisioned like three four years ago uh would you have done anything differently um because like L works uh personally I'm using it like on a daily basis everything works fine but people are quite critic on on some aspects uh especially the decentralization uh and some other technical stuff so what are your views on on layer tws how they have been designed how they have been created integrated and how they work today okay so one of the things that made me happy in 2024 well actually two things right one is that we finally have blobs and two is that we finally have stage one rollups right so optimism and arbit from stage one as evm rollups and then also Fuel and then dgate like go to stage two um like but but they're not evm but they got there very early so the uh so blobs they make sure the roll up so like actually have enough data to actually be scalable and they basically stop the layer 2 Market from competing with the layer one market and so as a result layer 2 transactions are finally like actually cheap and uh the uh uh stage one BAS basically means like the rollup actually has a proof system and the proof system like actually has teeth right like it actually contributes to deciding like which state route is the correct route and so the layer two is not just a multi right and so the way that stage one and stage two work basically are that stage one means that that a you have a security Council that needs 75% um in consensus in order to override the proof system and stage two means that the only chance in which any Security Council can have any influence at all is if the code provably has a bug like the code dis disagrees with itself either it does nothing for a week or it like gives two contradictory answers or you have different proof systems that disagree with each other and so on right and so like stage two is the one I think you can really call it being like properly decentralized right or fully decentralized and stage one is this kind of hybrid that's in the middle and Stage zero is like you're just a multi state right and so this year we've made big steps uh toward moving away from being just a multisig you have stage one rollups and there are many teams that are telling me that they're going to be able to get the stage two next year and like some even very early next year um so it's just about time this is what you mean exactly it's about time also the other thing I think like the interoperability discussion is important right I think for the first uh couple of years we were definitely not appreciating enough the need to like really push standards and care about interoperability and now of course you know we're realizing the need to like make ethereum feel like a unified ecosystem instead of just being like 43 different blockchains and so that's something where uh there's a lot of work that's happening right now so excited about that being uh becoming a soloft problem next year um so yeah do you think do you think solena pushed you to accelerate on this side and I think a lot of things uh pushed us um I mean I think uh in know another one is just like the internal pressure from inside of the ethereum ecosystem right like uh it's uh like I mean definitely you know salon and like bad bad ebtc price action and all of those things have made people a lot more willing to like actually like get off their butts and like be be radical and try to solve things more quickly and but then the other thing is like we've finally moved to that stage where action is happening on layer 2os ler 2 is actually exist and it's just the problem that's staring everyone in the right that like these days all of the interesting applications are on layer 2os and so to do anything you have to jump between all these different layer 2os and like everyone sees the uh the problems very directly how can we prevent all the value migrating to the layer toos uh leaving like main Nets without any purpose and um do we want to prevent it h um yeah um so I think value capture is one of those like very fascinating and very complicated topics right and I think one of the challenges is like people just like we don't know where value capture really comes from right in a lot of in a lot of ways like uh you know there's the like one of the standard theories of where value comes from is discounted cash flow right and the whole ultrasound money thing was trying to play into that but then at the same time it's like you know Bitcoin has like no discounted cash flow at all right and like it but then Bitcoin is know the most valuable one then um you know like generally it's like the correlation between like having revenue and having value as an asset is like not not that strong um and the other way to look at it right is like it's like you know there are other chains that say things like you know we have a clear North Star our North Star is to be decentralized NASDAQ but then what's market cap of actual NASDAQ it's like low tens of billions of dollars right um so the there's a lot yeah there's like a lot of unknowns and so I think in that in this environment of very high uncertainty I think we need to focus on you know like what are like one is focus on the things that feel that that can be known and two is to just be very Diversified right and so I think uh like one of the interesting things that's been happening in the discourse in 2024 is like a lot of the old memes are coming back right like people love the idea of ethereum as the world computer and I think the other like one thing that's a good complement to that is this idea that came from Bangals in 2018 that's like eth as the triple point asset and the their idea there is basically that e has multiple different value streams so one of them is like basically eth as digital gold one of them is eth as discounted cash flow asset so so eth gets then the supply goes down and one is e as a collateral asset inside of applications right and all of those um things like they're additive with each other right it's like basically you know you really like any one of those existing like actually makes the other two stronger right and uh so I think like I don't think that we need to like sort of formally decide and say you know like yes e is a software company or or eth is digital gold I mean actually we definitely should not decide that eth is a software company right software companies right software companies get replaced every 20 years softare companies have to like constantly completely change their products every five years in order to stay relevant like those things are fundamentally add odds with being a blockchain that gives people trustfulness and dependability right and so the whole point of the original L2 vision is like layer one is trustful and defend dep dependable and Layer Two acts like a software company and uh so like the things are additive um but then it's like obviously not automatically true that all of those things happen right so like one of the concerns is basically is eth even going to be the dominant collateral asset or is it going to get out competed by usdc right and like that's an actual risk and like just supporting eth as a collateral asset and making sure that E is easy to use as one as something that is very important and so that's one um another part is uh like just like the level of attention right like if the level of attention goes to projects that have relatively little alignment with whole ethereum ecosystem then like the thing that they're going to push in front of their users is their own asset right and they're not going to even try pushing eth in front of their users right and so having a large share of attention be like concentrated in ecosystems and like things that are very closely attached to eth is and the like the whole ethereum ecosystem is like something that's very important right and so I think I mean this is also one of those ideas why like recently there's been this desire to push for um like some kind of like I think neutral rollups is the term right like the long-term vision is native rollups where you actually have like a precompile to do proof verification but the short-term idea is like B like nether with surge they recently announced that they want to do this like basically rollups where the the rollup has no special separate token the brands behind the rollup is just ethereum right and the rollups try as hard as they can to just set up all the technical parameters in a way that minimizes trust requirements is stage two from day one like basically stage two for as long as it has to be and then eventually becoming native rollups and uh support being maximally interoperable with ethereum L1 and all of these things right um so I think uh like that's one of the Reas reasons why that idea is valuable like I definitely think that as an ecosystem like we should be careful about this right we should be definitely make sure that you know eth like the attention doesn't flow to things that have zero interest in E gaining value uh but like there's also a lot of different ways that that can happen right and I think like the Diversified posture that the ethereum ecosystem has is good and it's a strength and we should also like build off of that and also make sure that each and every one of those parts of it is like supportive of the whole ethereum ecosystem good question on the layer to so imagine a world in which like the L one is way more performance compared to now like could l2s disappear or become useless or like all all will layer to still always significant and important within the E ecosystem maybe think about think about it like in 10 years or 20 years like is there a world in which happens you know yeah so I think I mean short term there's definitely work that can be done on making the Galler one more powerful right and there's a growing movements to increase the gas limit there's work on client optimization there's things like multi-dimensional gas like a few other optimizations that you can do like I think it's possible to like safely increase the gas limit by maybe a factor of 10 um but and that's like short in medium term right um then in the longer term I do think that there will always be a Frontier where you can get more scale and faster speed by making more risky tradeoffs right like basically I think there's like some amount of scale that you can get with just the layer one some amount of scale that you can get with Native rollups or like neutral rollups or just generally get like very secure rollups and there's some higher level of scale that you can get with plasma pre- confirmations technologies that have some higher level of assumptions added to them and so there always will be a difference right and that's fine right um and I think know the goal of ethereum should be that there are some applications that just happen on ler one um directly or that happen on these neutral rollups and then there's some applications that happen on other kinds of ler 2s where like it's just fundamentally not possible to deliver enough performance to satisfy those applications without risking sensualization but that's fine right because the whole point of a layer two is that the layer two like makes extra tradeoffs but then even if the layer two fails you can always Retreat back to later one yeah I wanted to talk about politics and and regulation um maybe topics that you like um but I was wondering like what are your views on recent elections in the US uh Donald Trump getting elected ETFs getting in uh musk directing um Doge like the efficiency Department like how does how will it impact the ecosystem in your opinion and um are you I don't know are you in discussion with the us on this side are you also in discussion with other countries like how how how is the political environment evolving around etherum menu yeah I me I think for crypto like as a first order consequence it's definitely just good as a legitimizing effect right like even in countries far like beyond the US where I've talks to governments like pushing um thing ideas that are favorable to crypto as like significantly easier than it was know two months ago and definitely is a fact um I think if you start know going a bit beyond crypto and start kind of asking the bigger questions right I think like one of the ways that I frame I you know like diak when we were talking about this earlier right is that there's a lot of people that feel stuck between these two sides where one of the sides is like you know growth is bad we should live in cottages and we should regulate everything and then the other side is like let's build big and amazing and flashy stuff but like five people contr control of it and uh like the general you know cultural Vibe political Vibe everything is that basically the first side got weaker and the second side got stronger right and like I think the ideas around you know decentralization are still continue to be very important right but it definitely like it it does do mean that just in terms of like Visions for the future the stronger competitor is the competitor that says let's just do a go go build great stuff and and uh you know I could not care about concentration of power and like relatively the weaker competitors like let's give up on technology and living Cottages right and yeah so so I think that like to A first order that's roughly what's uh what's what's happening and so I think but at the same time you know still there are basically I think there are important messages that our community needs to get out there that are not the same message as anti- crypto people obviously because we are crypto people and also that are not the same message as a lot of the people that have been putting like very big amounts of money into a political lobbying and I think you know different like groups in crypto continuing to just have that independent voice and have that uh independent story both uh to regulators and also so I think towards just like the wider public and people who are kind of just interested in or concerned about know what is the big picture everything is leading to continues to be important I think you met Vladimir Putin a couple of times and also other the leaders uh what other their thoughts on etherum in the ecosystem um like I'm not sure when you met like the largest leaders if it was like very recent or like like a few years ago but maybe you have some insights to share about it H I think I mean a lot of the time uh people in those positions they don't have like deep thoughts on uh crypto specifically right and uh like a lot of the time right these are people who uh you know they're definitely older generation than us you know their thoughts around things like technology economy regulation business they were definitely formed around you know themes that existed you know 20 years ago 30 years ago um and so like even when you have people that believe in things like you know free markets and like open economy in free Society like okay like those things are you know they're great and like those those perspectives sometimes lead them to be quite friendly but at the same time like at that top political level like you don't really yet get an understanding of like the the specifics right the but the understanding of the of the specifics generally happens at like the Civil Service level like there's a lot of people in lower levels of government that are like often very crypto native and you know participate in you know applications and you like have coins and uh like just know about about all of these topics and like participate just as you and I do um so a lot of like there's definitely a growing number of people that are like that I think 10 years ago that was not true at all right I think now it it is true um and so so think yeah like right like maybe 10 years ago right like the strategy was basically that you know it was not realistic that they could understand in a positive way and the best you could hope for is to just like stay out of the eye of salon for as long as possible and I think now like the more realistic thing is to like actually like like present in Active Vision that that actually makes sense and that a that that aligns with enough of their objective and to like help people in those in those positions see the alignment of interests where it exists right I yeah I mean I I mean I'm personally definitely like bearish on you know like Russian institutional use of crypto I mean even just like completely putting aside morals and like thinking about this in like a very realistic pragmatic sense right like generally if you're a large country like a default perspective that you'll have is like you favor things that you control and things that nobody controls are like the you know like the second alternative right if you're a smaller country then like you have no chance in hell of like actually being the controller and so you know the open and free stuff is sort of more natively interesting and for larger countries I mean they like I think at the institutional level like you just have lots of Alternatives other than crypto right like there's know yeah so so you don't you don't think that like United States or Russia will like uh buy Bitcoin or buy e and get like a strategic Reserve like this is something that you bearish on I don't know that's I this is tricky yeah it's yeah tricky challenging um yeah but like I guess for the payments use case like I feel like if you're an institution like if if you're a large country yeah government then you know there there's lots of ways other than crypto to get to do what you need right there's like all kinds of bilateral trade options and then like all of the you know like bricks stuff around us independent Financial systems is like continuing to happen like I think the types of people that crypto more uniquely helps are like you know the little dogs and people that don't have those like institutional connections with any superpower uh but uh yeah we'll see um what do you think about the threats that are around etherum especially when it comes to um more Eve getting into ETF and that will be probably sted at a point little controlling most of like etherum Stak and also having layers of risk uh getting added with restacking and EG and layer and all solutions like that is is it something that you're worried about uh is it something that you're fighting in any way no because like since since etherum went to the proof of stake those are kind things to think about I guess yes yeah I think it is a concern um and you know if the like if ethereum gets super concentrated in like a one single ETF or a few single ETFs like that's definitely a big risk um I think that like having more Diversified staking is definitely super valuable and I think we should try to promote it as much as we can right and so you know like solo and Squad staking are good and I think the right kind of decentralized saking pools are good um I think even like Lio I think it's like it's better that it has like 25% than if it has 0o perent though I think it would be worse if it has 75% than if it had 25% um so I think it's you know one of those balances um it's uh yeah it's something that we need to watch out for and I think like promoting staking decentralization but also making staking more robust against cases like 51% attacks and like a lot of concentration right is importance too and so for those reasons I've been like promoting a lot this I um you know 51% attack resistance um also inclusion lists and like some of those censorship resistance ideas so I think all of that is important I wanted to maybe finish uh around AI because it seems something that you're kind of interested in right now um I think you mentioned um the Quantum resistance a problem and issue that we could get but is Agi a bigger threat compared to consume Computing or is it linked in any way you know especially for blockchains uh I mean so so first like on the quantum stuff in general right so the basic uh like way in which this will affect us is that quantum computers they break elliptic grve cryptography but not hashes right so they break about half of the cryptography that ethereum depends on but but for each individual thing the quantum computers break we already know of a Quantum safe replacement the reason why we don't use them today is because they're less efficient than the quantum vulnerable things but eventually we will have to switch it up right and like we know what's the timeline on this s chure but what what can we expect I think okay if we had to scramble like if literally quantum computers were coming in six months we had to replace everything in six months we could do it in six months right but uh that's like if we had to scramble drop everything like do extremely unsafe Alternatives probably give up on staking decentralization like all kinds of things right I mean in doing it well I think it's a matter of prioritization like I think realistically we'll see Quantum save ethereum in five to 10 years but like the priorities will get adjusted as we get more information about how close quantum computers are um and then so it's not that serious for now it's like not in one or two years it's probably in five out 10 this is what you're saying yeah I think five like yeah about like 10 years for quantum computers breaking cryptography I think is still a realistic timeline okay um yeah and then for AI I mean I personally don't really see Quantum and AI as being like super connected to each other right and like one maybe a na question but I'm like AGI consume Computing what happens um oh like if you get both I don't know I mean so far like my honest opinion is that I think Quant computers are just not going to be that big a deal and the reason why I say this is because like the main algorithm that quantum computers can do that's like useful is Grovers algorithm right which basically lets you speed up what are called search problems quadratically right so like you can do a search problem of size like one billion billion in the time in the number of Step In in one billion steps right but the but then we're going to expect early quantum computers to be uh relatively uh like slow to have high overhead right and so like the amount of effort per computation is going to be higher on the quantum computers and so I expect even though like theoretically quantum computers like break know like Bitcoin mining and you know a lot of things but like in practice I don't expect them to like actually be more efficient for quite a while right but meanwhile AGI on the other hand is this like crazy thing that's just going to completely overturn how the world works right so I guess Quantum plus AGI just looks mostly like AGI and like do you think we are overestimating uh overestimating or underestimating the impact of AI uh to the world we live in you know like is it like are we too too crazy about it you know when we think about it and like the the time it would take to make changes like especially people think like things will change like very quickly um like are we overestimating this or what are your thoughts about like all things will progress um I think there's a lot of uncertainty like I think there's a lot of uncertainty in how fast um AGI will come like there's this debate of basically the debate is is the current set of strategies that AI is using one that is fundamentally missing like some some categories of the in intelligence that humans have that's like fundamental to our ability to think and come up with all the amazing things that we've come up with or is it basically just a matter of scale right and like to me both sides are plausible right um like the the argument is basically that AIS have been super massively super human at specific tasks for like 50 years right so um you know arithmetic they've been super human um calculus they've been super human for a long time chess super human for 20 years uh and uh but at the same time like there have been other like aspects of how we think where humans computers have just barely caught up like right now right and the way that I think about the distinction between what do great already and what they might be like what the current approach is might not be able to do is like interpolation versus extrapolation right it's like is the new thing that you're asking the AI to do something that is within the range of the like within the same category as the training data that it's already seen or are you asking it to do something that's like fundamentally new right and there have been some interesting attempts to try to formalize this so f had this uh podcast with dwares I'd encourage people to listen to it uh he has this thing called The Arc prize it's Arc pri.org where he came up with his benchmark test of like a puzzle that humans can solve like it's not super easy but it's also not super hard but where AIS just have an incredibly difficult time solving and just like it feels alike in what like an IQ one of those IQ test questions right especially if you take like some of the more recent IQ tests that like try to be culturally neutral right it's like you know you look at like boxes and you try to find like geometric patterns it looks like one of those but like it's still surprisingly hard for the AI to do a good job on those right and uh but like that's only one example right so I think even if Arc price is broken there's still a possibility that like AI extrapolation is fundamentally hard for AI um but the argument is basically that like maybe there's a different style of thinking like maybe instead of gradient descent it's like search right and like basically there's like a style of thinking it's like search that humans are also good at but that AI like the gradient descent approach just like gets you nowhere right and so I think it's it's this unknown right like basically how much further you have to optimize in terms of fundamental approaches I mean this year we've already seen um you know like just raw scaling stop working as effectively right so we've seen you know the GPT is basically switched to they've been switching away from scaling training time and they've switch to scaling compute time right basically if you use like 01 basically the 01 what it does like it talks to itself for a minute before it gives you the answer and that's like already a different technique um so been using it's great yeah yeah yeah it is great right um but you know it's definitely like still there are still like these big regions where like it's it can't get quite get to human level reasoning and like it and if you try to keep pushing it it still gets stuck and so the question like yeah how difficult is it to get past that like is there some um like if you think of it as you know in the 1980s and 1990s like maybe onethird of human thought AI is just completely surpassed like basically right now are we in a world where AI completely surpassed another onethird of human thought and there's like a last onethird or a last like maybe 10 or 20% that will take another generation or are we basically like on a on a you know trajectory and like come in the overturn everything in 5 to 10 years and like I don't know right there's like super confident people that are super confident in both directions and I just think it's completely crazy to be super confident about anything so yeah be open to both possibilities very interesting I wanted to finish with a small extra questions help fer questions um so uh we've seen that you appeared with um with the founder of a and founder of iper liquid and and other ones other Builder as you mentioned you're meeting more and more people like building applications on on ethereum who are your favorite ones like all the the ones that you like the most I know it's a bit arbitary but maybe the ones that you that get you the more excited about the the future of eum okay um so I think with applications in general like I have a lot of respect for things that just keep stay working for a long time and just like do a simple and useful thing right so I've respected Unis swap for that reason um I think a has done a good job of like really entering that category like it's I think at this point it's like very dependable and reliable thing in the same way that like maker was five years ago um then again in the prediction Market space um I mean obviously like poly Market is the big one though recently I've also been trying like see what the rest of that space is like um Martin Copan he has just like done amazing stuff in like all of the different regions right so safe the wallet I use it Cal swap I use it Omen like he's also done his own prediction Market thing circles you know the basic income token I think it's really interesting too um then I mean optimism people I uh like I respect in particular for the like retro public goods finding side of it right because like you know they are ler too but they also do the Retro pgf and that stuff is just incredibly valuable and like I definitely call it what kind of application layer though it's obviously you know an ecosystem wide thing um know it's done a great job of just funding all kinds of developers um then uh and the the across team like they've done a good job of pushing uh cross layer 2 swaps and ERC 7683 and like trying to make that a decentralized standard um then forecaster and lens um both of those for centralized social um Firefly so suji Yan and from The Mask Network like he has been continuing to like try to figure out decentralized Social Media stuff for quite a long time and uh it feels like well what Firefly is right now is like it's basically a multi client right so it's like a Twitter client and the lens client and the foraster client and a client for other things as well um so trying to just like make the decentralized social media World very yeah like useful in that way um yeah do you get inspired by them by who by them like do do you get some inspiration like in new work from them or is it like mostly on your side digging like all this stuff I think I think so yeah I think and there's definitely yeah like ideas that come from them that I end up finding very very valuable and uh like it's also just great to you know get the real life experience of like seeing what works and what doesn't what do you like the most and hate the most about Bitcoin and ethereum would you like the most about Bitcoin and ethereum yeah likes the most and hates the most oh hate the most um um I mean I think uh mean with Bitcoin like I I definitely just like respect that it's a simple thing like they yeah they they know what they're doing you know you can use it it works for what it works for like it's a simple and dumb technology that doesn't uh you know like try to push other complicated stuff on you um for what I like the least I think I mean definitely like the surrounding culture around uh Bitcoin um so the facts that like the the high priest that they that they seem to respect the most is Michael sailor like on like that guy is just totally cringe you know he yeah the like yeah I saw like someone's uh some some tweet that was just like I forget the context it was just like listing um you know like founders of different or like the leaders of different coins and like basically saying you know like what would an toally say what would vitalic say and then for Bitcoin they listed Michael sailor and like the fact that bitcoin's become an ecosystem where like that's what gets celebrated and that's like the conventionally recognized number one character yeah I don't know that like that and then also just on top of that like you have uh you know like bit the Bitcoin conference and they have these ads that like proud that are proudly saying like you know one was like it was the Bitcoin some Bitcoin Med website that was saying like Russia is legalizing Bitcoin mining and they have like you know Vladimir Putin with like a glass of wine and crating and then it's like they just do all of these different things and like why okay so that's Bitcoin um for ethereum interesting yeah for ethereum it's uh like what do I like I I like definitely just the community and the values that people have the things that people care about the spirit of wanting to build things that are useful for for the world The Cooperative Spirit of people wanting to work together um the like will to the the interest in building open and decentralized systems that are like really at the same time like valuable for helping people and solving um real problems and at the same time really taking a balanced approach to things um the thing that I dislike the most about ethereum I think realistically like the the complexity of the protocol as it currently is like I think it could be made three times simpler and I think it should be and I think we should be willing to make some hard choices in order to push it in that direction so that's one of the reasons why I actually really respect the like the Justin beam chain thing right it's a you know I mean obviously yeah you know we have to there's a lot of really important stuff that we have to ship to users along before 2029 right and we are right so like about a week ago we agreed in the yra hard Fork to add blobs and or to increase the blob count right so the target is going up from three to six and I think that's just like very important for l2s and also a strong signal that you know we actually care about scaling in that our Bots actually are off the ground now um yeah like I think I would have been more bearish on ethereum if that hadn't happened um and you know so increasing blob count um you know pushing forward on account abstraction 7702 has been I think very good this year for like really unifying the community around an account abstraction road map that solves both the security and the yeah user experience and functionality concerns um so yeah a lot of uh like good stuff happening in the short term but also like at some point the ethereum protocol is definitely becoming more and more of a and like at some point we have to just explicitly go and say hey we're cleaning it up and you know like if if that breaks backwards compatibility and like too bad like we have to make a python 2 Python 3 switch at some point and I think you know the beam chain is good so hopefully yeah that happens I think it's okay for that to be like second priority after all of the really urgent user scaling stuff but that does need to happen at some point thank you very much for your time uh I really want want to thank you for all the time and and help you you've been doing especially with the French speaking Community uh I think you changed a lot of lives uh within the audience uh including me so thank you for everything um and I would like to finish this interview with your words so do you have any words for the French speaking Community um especially around E I guess [Music] okay and maybe in English I guess yeah no in English know I yeah and I think the next uh a year for ethereum I think is just going to be a very exciting year I think you know like a lot of infrastructure is uh out there a lot know people really care about building applications people really care about making the ecosystem work well people really care about like finally getting out there and building and executing on Division and uh I think now is like an amazing time to get into the ethereum community and uh just build the things that we've been excited about using blockchains to build the whole time thank you",

    "content": "hello guys so we are now in Singapore withal bin who is a creator of and great to have you here with Al yeah thank you Ser so much and good to be here so can I tell how everything started uh like about your childhood and how did you discover bin mhm yeah um so I was I you know born in Russia moved to Canada when I was six grew up in Canada went to um you know Canadian School in Toronto um I first heard of Bitcoin when I was uh 17 and uh from two places at the same time um so there was my dad and also some podcasts that I was listening to online and my dad just mentioned to me Bitcoin and he mentioned that like hey this is a really interesting currency um it's a a purely digital currency not connected to like any kind of government and I at first I found the idea interesting but I was kind of suspicious because I did not really understand how a currency could have value without being backed by anything but then I also um at the same time um or maybe a couple of weeks later heard about it from this podcast that described it in some more detail out of what it is and what some of its goals are and I decided it was worth at least investigating um a little bit and so I went through the Bitcoin forums and I was looking for some way that I could participate in the economy and earn some Bitcoin and I found someone who was offering to pay me five Bitcoins per article which back then was four $4 per article to write articles for uh Bitcoin weekly which was his blog so I did that um and then I wrote a bunch of Articles then eventually someone named Mi Alisia from Romania reached out to me saying he was making a physical coin magazine um so I started writing for that and while I was in school I started getting into more and more Bitcoin things I was um attracted by I think a lot of things about Bitcoin at the same time like there's the technological um and mathematical aspect and you can understand and appreciate the cryptography that goes into it for example there's the economic and political aspect the ideas of Austrian economics the uh idea of like creating a currency that can't arbitrarily be inflated that is you know unconnected to a government um and is just when people voluntarily doing things independently um there's the fact that it is um you know free and open source software and like you can personally go download it you can see what the code is you can try changing the code um you know you could see how the entire protocol works and write your own things that talk to it um so I appreciated I think all of these different angles and they started getting deeper and deeper into the Bitcoin space first as a writer and then after I learned enough from writing I also started being a developer so in uh 2013 um this was when I was already starting University I started accepting uh bounties to work on uh projects for colored coins and colored coins were basically you could think of them as like an early version of a combination of like erc20 and erc721 so you could issue I like individual nfts the like back then no one you know used the word nfts or um your own like tokens that could could represent different assets on top of Bitcoin so I found that interesting I started working for that then I uh started this six-month trip around the Bitcoin world just visiting all the different Bitcoin communities eventually met some other people that were working on some other projects trying to extend like the Bitcoin protocol or build their own protocols that we're trying to support issuing assets on ethereum doing Financial contracts on ethereum doing other kinds of or sorry issuing assets on bitcoin doing Financial contracts on bitcoin and doing other kinds of cool things I worked for some of these teams and eventually I had this idea that it just makes sense to build something general purpose um and this was something that like those projects were not willing to go straight into doing but I just immediately felt like this was the obvious step that you should just start from and so I started working on a white paper for like what a yes system that contains a general purpose programming language would look like sent that white paper out some people wrote back saying that they wanted to help and ethereum project started from there um so the white paper talked the ethereum white paper talks about a lot of the use cases that we were excited about at the beginning right so there was obviously issuing your own assets there's uh know like making a decentralized know like username and domain name system which turned into ens there's uh Financial contracts um and financial derivatives and that turned into know stable coins there was uh know prediction markets which still exist today there were daos which are of course very big today um and you know ethereum just started growing from there and when you started eum when the idea of starting eum come to you did you have a vision that it may become so big as it is now I was not expecting that at all um actually when I first started the project the first thought that I had was that this was just a fairly small thing I would get it done with in a few months and it would exist and people could benefit from it and then I would go back to University it actually took me until Bitcoin Miami in January 2014 where I saw just the sheer scale of interest in the project that I realized that like this would actually be bigger and that I'm staying out of university for a long time and in childhood um did you have like any dream job what did you want to do in future um I think if you had asked me when I was nine I would have answered that I want to be a scientist without really understanding what a scientist is like I just thought that you know physics and chemistry are cool um I I uh and when I was growing up I uh started doing programming fairly early I was basically programming video games for myself to play did you Lear yourself program or did your father teach you my dad bought some uh books about programming for me to read and I read them and I tried following them yeah and can you tell how it evolved how did you find the partners to start the project and so on yeah yeah so I mean the process for finding Partners was uh very basic back then like I I wrote this white paper I sent it out to 15 of my friends and then they sent it out each to 15 of their friends and then people exactly and then people just started coming in and emailing saying can I help and like the first 10 people who did that became co-founders um so it started off in a uh you know a way that I'm sure a lot of people who have seen you know like startups form would pretty strongly criticize and you know like there did end up being a lot of you know negative consequences and problems that of ended up from that approach but uh you know just the core of the projects just kept going um so white paper came out in November 2013 then the ethereum crowd sale which raised the money to build the project started in July 2014 the ethereum blockchain launched in July 2015 um and from there it's just basically been constant improvements right and I think there's been at least one hard Fork every year I believe for each of those years um and then right um even actually back in 2014 work on the two biggest problems you know Pro switching to proof of stake and improving scalability started right from there right so back in January 2014 I had a blog post describing this algorithm called slasher which was just a candidate like very simple version for proof of stake and and at the time the blog post was written in a way that's like very careful like we are not intent on switching to proof of stake but like if a good algorithm comes out we'll consider it and here is one possible candidate but then by the end of 2014 we're like very intent and then for scalability there was obviously ler one scaling research on sharting and then ler two scaling research which started off from State channels which were an extension of payments channels which were an idea from Bitcoin that then turned into the lightning Network there was then plasma which was this unique thing that like you really do need to just have ethereum like you can't do them on top of Bitcoin um and then eventually our experiments and like just learning the limitations of both of those led to uh rollups which I think in some ways kind of are a convergence between the layer one and the layer two research because uh rollups are very general purpose like you can build on rollups using exactly the same code that you build on ethereum which is something that's not true of like channels or plasma right um and then rollups the trade-offs that they have is they require you to put some amount of data on chain and so rollups scale computation but they don't scale data and so you still need some kind of shorting to scale data right and so the research around data availability sampling started back in 2017 and it continued from there um so that's um you know like roughly the uh technical I guess Pro progress of uh the project since then but then at the same time there was a huge amount of work on you know like applications and Defi and inventing things like automated market makers and Unis Swap and nfts which was something I totally did not see coming and you know all all of these different areas at the same time and like the all of those things together basically make ethereum what it is today uh why do you not see nfds as a good thing um well I know I did not say I don't see NFD as a good thing I I did not see them coming like nfts surprised me right um and uh I think nfts are this complicated thing where there's a lot of like good use cases that I like like I I like nfts that have interesting properties attached to them that are parts parts of other applications I uh like it when you know like nfts can help make you know really good works of art get funded um and help you know like artists and all kinds of countries around the world like basically make the same amount of um you know like money that you can make in the west and I think those are things are really cool um the thing that I'm less excited about out is like you know the $3 million monkeys um yeah so I am optimistic that the nft space will just increase in quality over time like I think it's uh we're already seeing that some of the less sustainable models have kind of fallen off over the last couple of years and I think there's higher standards in terms of what you have to create if you want to create something that people even care about today um so I'm optimistic that we'll see better and better things from you like nfts and from games this decade so what are views on blockchain games as games Builder yourself back then are you excited about blockchain games yeah I mean I think um blockchain games could be good um but the most important thing for a blockchain game is that I think it needs to be fun without the blockchain part right like I think one of the errors that some uh things made in know 2020 and 2021 is like they used the blockchain and the toen Casino aspect as a substitute for fun and the problem with that approach is that it looks like it works well when there is a bull market and all the prices are rising but then once the bull market ends everyone just loses interest right because there's no reason to stay and you know we saw I think this actually play out right and you know like we saw you know like things like Axel Infinity for example where they did really well during the ball Market but then they were just not good enough at attracting people and like retaining people during the bear um and like I think it's uh valuable to think of this from an economic perspective right like when you're making a game that has a trading component you're making an economic system right and from a currency accounting point of view it's zero sum right for every dollar that someone gains someone else has to lose a dollar and so if you're going to do something that does play to earn someone else has to be playing to spend right but then for those people who are losing um you know eth or whatever currency on in on the accounting table for them to stay they have to be getting some other kind of value that drives them to keep staying right and like this has been done in the past right like basically just have to make a game that's fun I me I think EV on line is a good example of this it's uh you know not a blockchain game right but uh it was uh like the game that made headlines back in the early 2000s for know like oh major space battle happens and a $25,000 ship has been destroyed right and back then like $25,000 was impressive right like I remember reading that as a kid and like I knew that know $25,000 is like a year of know the average person's salary it's enough to buy a car and like it's just a purely virtual item and in three hours of playing a game somebody loses one right um so at the time like this was uh you know really impressive and really mind-blowing but you know obviously the players kept coming back right and uh you know the reason why the players kept coming back is that E online is actually fun uh so I like that is the sort of thing that I think someone making a blockchain game uh today has to replicate if they wants to be successful like for the people who are gaining money like okay it's PL to earn and that's fine but like for the people who are who are you know losing money so that the others can gain like they need to have some other non-monetary reason that is you know worth the cost to them for them to keep coming back right right and uh I I don't think that the first round of blockchain games really provided that but I am optimistic that people kind of learn the lesson that that is what you need to have and do you still yourself play not really I yeah yeah do unfortunately do not really have much time for game playing and what use cases of blockchain application exi yeah I think um there's a a few different categories of blockchain applications that I think can be valuable and like I wrote some of this in a post I made at the end of last year it's called what in the ethereum ecosystem excites me I think or something like that right if you go to my blog vitalic doca like you just can control up for that and find it but the summary there is uh and I think one the currency applications just continue to be really valuable for people I think it's sometimes easy to sort of dismiss them as being basic and boring but it's important to remember that like they are a big part of what a lot of people especially in the developing world just need and care about right um and know when I been to places like you know like Latin America or Africa I mean you know the nft markets exist and uh you know they're valuable but in part one of the reasons why is because they you know provide a way for creators to make a living um the you know blockchain games are also valuable but you know in part also because you know the play to earn aspect gives people a way to make a living um but then the other big thing is just people need places to save money and that people need to make transactions and a lot of people are just in countries where that is you know really hard right um and that so just giving people those basic tools I think is really important right so that's currency applications then another cluster of applications that excite me is everything in the space of like identity related things reputation related things and like maybe decentralized social um I view it as like a big cluster because I think there's this many-sided network effect where different things really plug into each other right so like going into the specifics of one application like I've been using foraster a lot recently right far is one of these kind of alt twitters that people have come up with right like there's you know obviously a lot of interest in creating alternatives to Twitter now that uh you know lots of people are either unhappy with various things that Elon does or people just you are realizing that like this is a monopoly and like we need Alternatives right and and some of these have been on chain and I think the value of doing them on chain is that you really gain access to like some of these other things that you can plug into right so for example if you take forecaster my my forecaster account is connected to an ethereum address and so if I lose my forecaster key I can use my ethereum address to recover it right um and this is like actually more secure than what centralized social media does where they rely on M phone numbers that can be hacked as know I discovered this week um emails that are dependent on a centralized provider and where often if you lose your email like your even your centralized provider themselves you know they get take a long time to respond or often just don't respond um whereas like in ethereum address you know you can set it up as a multisig wallet I know you can do your own uh recovery in various ways and it actually works much better um then you can use onchain stuff for reputation right so like one of the big challenges in social media is like how do you tell you know who is a human and who is a bot right and there's just lots of incentives for malicious actors to just create 50,000 Bots and unfortunately with modern AI you just can't tell that someone is not a bot by verifying that they can identify which of the 16 squares are a giraffe right like the Bots do that better than the people do these days um so the nice thing about ethereum is that it already has this like Lively unchain ecosystem where there's different ways of doing that right like one is you can verify just the existence of activity on an ethereum account right to have acity you need to pay transaction fees and so there's a cost right and so you can't like you can make a few hundred fake accounts if you can pay a cost but you can't make a million of them um two is you can look at you know like popes right the proof tokens of the proof of attendance protocol um that verify that you participated in various um you know iners or online events um three there's proof of personhood protocols you know there's a proof of humanity there's idena there's an all World coin there's like a growing list of these right um there's gitcoin pass that kind of Aggregates a lot of those so there's already like unchain things that you can use to prove look that you're a person and I think the ideal goal here right is to do this in a way that is like lets people prove that they're people and not Bots but also still is compatible with I you know the goals of like letting preserving people's privacy and preserving people's freedom right like a lot of people value the ability to post anonymously for example and that's something that becomes a lot harder if you just like lock everything down and say like to do anything at all you need to provide a passport right um so I think the crypto space is actually in a very good position to offer an alternative to that um then there is um um another problem is just finding ways to identify like who is in the same community you right and like grouping together people who have similar interests even doing things like polls where those polls might only be targeted toward a particular community and with uh you know popes you could do that too right and so I think like forter and like what can be done with farcaster in the future is a good example of this because like it's a good example of how all of these different components that are being made within the crypto space really fit together and really can create the decentralized social media platform in a way that like actually solves a lot of the problems of the centralized systems that exist today and do you think we will ever see the mass adoption of decentralized social media like new startups so will those centralized platforms will have to switch to decentralized models to keep up I think we'll see a combination of both um and I think uh I mean with forecaster itself um the reason why I think it's been as successful as it has is that it's done a good job of community building like it's uh I think uh one of the challenges with community building is that like this is all you know like done in a context where the big one is Twitter and people are unhappy with Twitter because people are unhappy with Elon and the challenge is like even though you know there's definitely a lot of places where I disagree with things that Elon does but having an identity that's like like purely negative where like you're creating a product that's purely about not liking something like that just doesn't create a healthy Community even if you you know have a good reason for that right like I think that's true here it was true with Bitcoin cash for example which like where I agreed with I you know like Bitcoin cashes side of the you know Bitcoin block size debate but I also think uh it it just obviously ended up going in unhealthy directions for quite a few years as a community um so foraster done a good job of like not being about that they're more about you know we are just going to do the experiment of seeing what would a Twitter that is based on the ethereum platform and ethereum principles look like which I think is super valuable and I think even if all of the other social medias like really reform themselves I could see Mano foraster for example getting a very being in a very good position because of that by itself right and then you know cens is the other one which is um I think in a in a similar position to I think be able to succeed for some similar reasons um so like I think it's just important to remember right that especially social things they don't just compete on quality like you're not selling a technology you're selling a community right um and so there's all of these other factors that are independent of like whether you're actually centralized or actually decentralized that just matter a lot right but what I expect to happen is uh I think some combination of uh you know new platform succeeding and old platforms being inspired by either ideas from the the decentralized world like I think Community notes is you know a good example right you know there I think there's you know aspects of the at least ideas that have been thought about in the decentralized world that uh you know like seem like they've kind of inspired a lot of the approach and like it is a still a technologically centralized system but it's open source and you can download and you can see the data and you can verify it yourself um and like I hope to see more things that look like that um but I also um know think we we could easily see like other deeper kinds of uh integration right like if other forms of proof of person had become successful then like it would be interesting to see them I you know apply using that for verification um Zer knowledge proofs for verification I hope will start getting used a lot um so I think there will be like individual components and individual ideas that will get absorbed but I think there is also a place for these projects that you know really try to go stick to the principles and the community and go deep and he recently as well released a research paper on the privacy and implementation of privacy proofs and zero knowledge proofs to be compli but to presolve the Privacy features so can you tell more about this and why do privacy matters and how this problem Sol and implemented by the government bodies or corporations and future sure I mean I think privacy is something that you know we as a civilization have always had for thousands of years without ever really thinking much about it right it's you know just like physical cache is completely Anonymous and you know we've used that for several years and a lot of aspects of the physical world like just people's ability to have a conversation that is not recorded is something it's just been you know part of the world basically ever since uh you know the world started and that people started existing right and but a lot of these things are really I think in danger of being eroded very quickly now that the digitization uh transition is happening right like we're seeing a rapid switch to you know cash society and cbdcs and even when cbdcs are not being used these various kind of corporate payment systems and those systems do a pretty horrible job of protecting privacy right like it's a you know there's a back door that can basically see like everyone's Financial history and then you know like unfortunately know there's definitely people that want to try to make us apply a similar thing to people's ability to have conversations right and I think this is a big risk um I think it's a a big risk because uh privacy is uh an important protection for individuals and for groups of people that are not lucky enough to um you know have their own government or have know like some kind of powerful entity protecting them and it just it just allows them to exist and to be themselves and to um you know have their have their lives without um you know like having everything that they do be kind of subjected to and being judged by you know like these really powerful um you know like or social organisms that are just like way stronger than any of them right and I think this uh you know this balance of power between um you know like small actors and big actors I think there's a very big risk that uh the default direction of at least the next wave of Technology over the next few decades to really go in the uh direction of you know empowering the bigger actors and I think uh this is something that could be really dangerous it's uh you know it can Empower dictators um obviously it could uh empower large corporations to maintain a very powerful position in a market that like other people cannot break into and privacy to me is like a a really strong and important protection against that and just against much simpler things like people um you know like have being able to have conversations without some risk that like the data gets leaked five years later and then they just get you know judged out of context like socially for that right so I think privacy is value and I think we have we stand a big chance of you know really losing it and a lot of the work that's being done that's been done by cryptographers for the last half century has been about really trying to preserve and expand the space of uh privacy at least in the digital realm and like it's had a lot of successes right like um you know we have endtoend ENC corrupted Communications which I think is amazing right in the case of money um I think the uh the the the challenge there is that like when you know people being able to have privacy with their money is just important right because uh like Mo just modern like even political organizing is not possible without spending at least some amount of money right and so if you know like all all of your uh payments can be tracked then like you know that that just makes it possible for not just governments but even corporations too to just like immediately basically identify you know like what groups are part of what what things people are trying to do and know what people's values are and that just uh makes it really easy to know like go against and discriminate against them um and just even if people are not doing anything political like uh you know your financial life just reveals so much about your personal life that I think there's no way to say that it to anything but that you know like Financial actions should be part of your personal life uh but the flip side of this is of course that like Bad actors use these systems right and uh a lot of this includes um you know Bad actors that are governments and that also um know really hurt the you know the freedoms of a lot of other people right so soor cash was you know the biggest privacy application on ethereum and like lots of people have used it and like I've used it personally a lot right but also you know like hackers that have used it and we've seen that some there's some degree of evidence that some that some of them have been connected to North Korea and I think you know if we have a privacy system where like 70% or like 40% of the money going into it just like is money from thieves then people are just not going to trust it right like exchanges are not going to trust coins coming out of it I think there's a a big risk that you know it'll be banned in various ways there's a a big risk that you know like anyone who cares about en foring stions will just like completely reject it and so I think there is a value in like being pragmatic and the thing that I want to avoid is like people just uh going back to using back doors right CU like if someone wants to prevent criminal activity and they're lazy like their first instinct is to just say like let's do back doors right and let's uh you know like have some backd door key where the FBI can see everything and the problem with that is that I think like that really does compromise way too much privacy right and it's I think like I think that's a red line that we really should try maximally hard to defend but then the question is like well are there ways to you know prove that you're not a bad guy without revealing everything and the really amazing things about about zero knowledge proofs is that the answer is yes right the answer is you know yes you can make a zero knowledge proof that proves very specific things either about yourself or about specific coins that you're um introducing into a system and you can prove things like I have coins that are where I'm not revealing anything about where they came from except that they're not one of these 57 known defi hackers right and if you do that and if most people do that then the amount of money that defi hackers are going to successfully able to extract with uh without getting caught is going to be like maybe 10 times lower than it is today right um and like that's already enough to you know encourage them to kind of go legit and you know return 95 % of the money and collect the white head bouny instead right um so then like if we have that then like that really yeah like really takes away like 90% of the downside of these uh um of this kind of strong privacy but at the same time it basically preserves the kind of privacy that's uh really valuable for regular people right because regular people still would have a very large set of different actors that they can mix with um so this is still an early stage idea right and I think it's going to be implemented across a lot of ethereum solutions and you know we'll see how it actually plays out in practice um and I think we'll learn a lot from it right but I think the general idea that like zero knowledge proofs create possibilities for um you look both preventing Bad actors and at the same time uh preserving people's uh privacy to an extent that was not really possible before um is uh one that's really valuable and like hope to see people using you know both privacy tools and pools and other kinds of ideas that are in that spirit and you talk currently quite a lot about account obstruction social recovery buets so can you explain in the simple V what it is for the V audience and why is it important and as well we see like Visa research that uh can enable automated payments with account abstraction and so on so can you tell about so a smart wallet is a wallet like an account on ethereum that is instead of being controlled by a private key controlled by a program programs are great because programs can have more complicated logic so for example the simplest thing you can do as a multisig you could have like say five keys and a rule that says that you need three of them to approve a transaction or you could do more clever things and you could say one of them can approve a small value transaction but you need three of them to approve a large value transaction right this is actually how the ethereum foundation while it works today um you could have different signature algorithms you could even use signature algorithms that are included in other kind like existing like for other forms of authentication that people use today so like for example you could make a smart wallet that verifies signatures that are produced by a government digital ID card and like you could even wrap that inside in a sark right and you could have the smart wallet verify a sark to make that privacy preserving so you could take existing forms of authentication turn them into um you know ways of accessing an ethereum account you could do things like multi so you have multiple keys and so that gives you a lot more decentralization like protection against something wrong happening with any one of those keys you could switch to different kinds of cryptography like you can do a lot of things account abstraction is a set of technologies that just makes it much easier to actually use Smart wallets right smart wallets are possible today I use one but they're inconvenient a abstraction makes them more convenient to the point where they can actually become a default for average users and account abstraction is valuable because it just expands the the space of possibilities for how uh users wallets can be secured by so much right um so like for example if a new user joins ethereum and let's say all that they want to do is they want to deposit $500 and trade it in a prediction Market the biggest actual risk to that new user is that they're because they're not an experienced ethereum user they're just going to somehow forget about the wallet and then a year later just like accidentally lose all of the details for how to access it the best way to fix that is to have a wallet that is uh instead of protected by some new seed phrase that they have to store somewhere is protected by something that they already have in use one simple example is an email address right now this is centralized but you know for an average user that is currently fully in the centralized world that is only putting in a small amount of money this is like a pretty good choice for them right you know i' say the least bad choice in a lot of ways right and so they can make automatically an ethereum address where spending from or recovering that ethereum address requires a zero knowledge proof that they control a particular email address if you want if you are a more experienced user then you can make a multisig wallet right you can make a wallet where to send a transaction you need to have signatures from let's say four different addresses you contr control two of them but then like your um you know like family and friends control a few others or you can combine the two right so like if you want to you know control your own do this based on your own accounts you could have a three out of five where one of the five is a key that is on your phone another of the five is an you know an NFC card like a card that has a chip that you can tap against your phone a third of the uh five might be you know like some stored on like some server that just uh you know let small value transactions through but then like maybe send like sends a confirmation code for like larger value transactions a fourth could be a know like a friend which could could be their ethereum account it could even be their email address and then a fifth um know like could be some other institution right so like it opens up this uh much larger design space for how accounts that get secured that have options that are kind of more centralized but that are more convenient for people that are not in the ethereum world already but also have more secure and more decentralized approaches for people that are mil either very active ethereum users that use their their wallet frequently or people that use their wallet less frequently but they have larger amounts of money that wants to do something that's kind of more secure and more hardcore right so it really opens up that uh entire space of possibilities and as well last year year ago you achieved a big milestone transition of ethereum from proof of rock to proof of Stak so what are you currently focusing on what's next for you abstraction is definitely a really big and really important one um another thing is obviously scalability right so we have e 4844 also known as Proto dink shorting which is coming out very soon which basically adds more data space on the blockchain so not transactions but just Blobs of data and the purpose of this is to enable greater scalability specifically four layer two projects sell our rollups um and then after AP 4844 there's a longer term road map of increasing that amount of space over time um then ongoing improvements to proof of stake um identifying like ways that we can improve proof of stake decentralization even further for example um and then um improving the state of privacy um look with things like privacy polls as I mentioned um and I try find continuing to improve the state of uh like zero knowledge proofs and like our ability to actually use them in different applications um so yeah I think it's probably you know like those four proof of stake scalability privacy and account security and can we talked a year ago as well about intersection of and blockchain and it was before the release of CH and of all that so what do you views currently on AI industry I mean AI is obviously super important I mean it's a the sort of thing that's uh hard to think about because uh it's just so hard to predict like where it might go in the future and uh the like it's hard to I you know like use really logical arguments or are given historical precedence to try to estimate this right like you a lot of it is just uh really dependent on intuitions which seems just like very hard to avoid and depending on like which side of those issues you know like you fall on like it might be something that will just completely um know transform the world and make it basically unrecognizable in the next 15 years or it could be something that still takes another Century right um it's you know massive gains in you know like productivity but also like mass of like philosophical consequences just in terms of like what the role of humans in know this new world is going to be um so it's uh I think super important um the and and it's obviously super important to get right right like if the world is you know controlled by AI that just have completely different goals from us in a way that's difficult to detect at first then like that you know could also lead to very bad things happening too um but uh yeah so it's an important space to get right um in terms of the intersection between Ai and crypto this is one of those things where people have tried really hard to find an answer because everyone asks the same question and I think unfortunately part of the answer is just the intersection is less than it seems um there are a few things like their zkl but like it's realistically a pretty small area um there is just the fact I think that ai's rapid growth makes it much more important to solve certain problems like proof of personhood for example and uh those are problems that the crypto space has to ability to be very actively involved in um then there are problem um there's um know obviously the possibility of uh just crypto tokens being used by AIS there's the possibility of like Crypt based Dows um governing AIS and the process of training AIS so there's definitely some areas of like intersection that are possible but I think you know like unfortunately the bigger picture is that they are you know also different spaces that work in a lot of a lot of different ways and have different focuses and that's fine uh what about for example blockchain data analytics by AI or for example uh implementation of AI and ZK like for healthare data healthare data analysis for the patients or things like that yeah I think a lot of those like Fair small use cases exist right so in the case of like privacy pools for example like we have to construct these um what I call Association sets like the sets of you know which subset of deposits are you proving that you're coming from and that requires like just being very fast and AI could do a good job of that um then for healthcare applications I mean I think this is where zkl comes in right like you have ai algorithms and you're protecting privacy at the same time um AI is doing trading obviously that's been around since the beginning and like they don't talk about it because if you have a profitable algorithm them why would you tell other people how it works uh but you know it's uh happening um yeah there like I think there's a lot of these kind of smaller things and know especially as blockchain based applications become know more sophisticated um ai's trading in prediction markets is another interesting one right I think there's a lot of like micro prediction markets where AI is probably could do a better job than humans of uh trading of even providing like initial probab probabilities for certain questions and acting as market makers and uh and all all kinds of roles um and that might improve liquidity and like kind of keep making prediction markets even better um so yeah I think there's uh just a lot of these you know like small use use cases I like yeah I don't think there's like one super granted q janer but like there's definitely a lot of these different areas of intersection look at the edges that I think are definitely going to be quite important and in Spring as well you made like a special gathering for two months zalos so can you tell more about this how did the idea of starting zalo come to you and explain the what type of gine it was why did you decide to make it so zusa was basically this uh crazy social experiment like I think in the space of uh like ideas like uh you know creating new cities creating new communities or or bringing online communities offline I mean like Network States um and all these kinds of ideas like basically trying to ask the question that like you know in the modern day most people's uh you know values and communities are much more heavily based not on their current physical space but on you know things they're interested in and people that they care about that are online and trying to take those communities and like materialize them in um you know physical space right and uh this is something that like lots of philosophers have been talking about for decades right um but this is a thing where I thought that it's just a the discussion has been far too theoretical and it's time to try to like really make something practical um and just to do an experiment right and the goal waso was to be an experiment right so we've had hacker houses hacker houses often last years but they only have up to 10 or 20 people we have conferences conferences have thousands of people but they only last a week so let's make something that um has 200 people and also last for two months right so it's a big enough of a jump that we learn new things but it's also small enough that it's actually manageable um and with there a really basic brought together 200 people from a combination of the ethereum community the you know different biotech communities longevity and synthetic biology and just people who are enthusiasts in know governance and community building in general um and just basically told them to you know like come and like be a city for two months and I feel like the results of the experiment were definitely fascinating as in like zuu the form factor proved to be a success um but uh the I me know obviously unanswered question is still kind of weird all of these ideas go from here um so that's uh you know I think still something that's in the process of being discovered right and actually Zulu has already inspired a bunch of forks like I think there's something called moo happening in Thailand there's uh like I think a couple of others happening in different places so it'll be interesting to see what ends up coming out of that and do you believe in the future of idea of network states that we will have these communities which will become enough powerful uh to have enough power on the same level as governments have Network states are like an intentionally I think very vague term right um like it's the sort of word where anyone can hear it and they can like very easily project a lot of their own goals and dreams on top of it um and so this is actually part of why I think wasu we tried to intentionally minimize the use of the word network State like we you know don't want to like accidentally push people in one particular frame um I think communities are definitely going to be powerful right as a community you have the ability to do lots of things that as an individual you cannot do right so like one example in the longevity space is uh and a lot of people have heard about Brian Johnson now right just because he's this you know very fascinating kind of Larger than Life character basically you know like 100 millionaire um who spends basically his entire life doing all kinds of crazy exercise and like a highly optimized diet and taking all kinds of milk supplements and uh other kinds of treatments and lots of tests and basically trying to live as long as possible and be healthy for as long as possible but then you know you look at Brian Johnson and just obviously realized that like both from a money perspective and from a Time perspective this is something that's just to impractical for normal people right but that's what you have to do as an individual if you're a community you have economies of scale right like like I think anyone who's ever cooked right will know that cooking for four people is less than four times as hard as cooking for one person right um and might even be less than twice as hard um so and you know if you're taking the effort of figuring out some you know set of supplements for one person well you can just copy that that work and you do a little bit more and you have the exact same stuff for 200 people if you want to do measurements of one person you have the equipment that's already there and then you just form a line take a little bit more time and you can do it for everyone right um and so one of the sub goals of zuu I think has was to try to take the initial steps toward making a kind of Brian Johnson blueprint menu for the Everyman right like figure out what is the subset of that that you can actually do in a way that's uh like money affordable and time affordable for ordinary people people and so we had this uh breakfast uh like menu where we cooperated with a local restaurant and they did this breakfast buffet where we uh told them like one of the conditions is we cap the price at $15 a person per day and that way know we did end up losing some of the expensive ingredients but we gave like a healthy breakfast that is you know like low carb follows like a lot of the principles and that a lot of people really liked and appreciated and that at the same time was a good opportunity for people to have a basically a social Gathering space every day right um and then in there was also this culture where a lot of people would do cold plunges every morning I know we organized a gym so you know like really did all of that kind of more complic stuff that's like more difficult to arrange for one person but if you're in a community it's like right there right and trying to like basically make you know like the best out of that right so like that's I think one example of how communities can be powerful in a way that individuals are not um and the question of like what this means for politics I think is uh one of those big unknowns right um and I think the reason why it's a a big unknown is like first of all you know there there we have seen a lot of signs of governments actually being open-minded to this stuff right like there's lots of countries that now have things that are called you know digital Nomad visas for example right and I think 10 years ago the mindset was more that like digital Nomads are this kind of weird Gray Zone thing and nobody knows whether or not they're actually violating immigration and employment laws but uh you know governments have actually know stepped up and been welcoming toward them um and uh got created these Visa categories that made it very easy for people to stay in specific countries for long medium length periods of time um then we've uh and like when we talk to people about these ideas of like organizing exu type things like lots of people are very open right but then like you know the conversation started with network States right and you know like B who came up with the term you know he has the these know like really Grand political visions and you know like those values of like trying to like basically you know create a a future for of uh Freedom that like actually works even in a world where the you know the United States ends up failing in various ways and the theory would be that like you know if people are not happy with the country that they're in then they could move collectively to these Network States on mass and the fact that they're doing it as a collective like makes it much easier because I you know groups of people when they move over they can give each other help and support you know that when you're moving you're not just stepping off alone into the complete unknown you have a group of people who will be there and um who will support you and know you can like just like have protection and have and have friends and that this will also like even discourage governments from you know doing really terrible things because they know that it'll just be that much easier for like basically all the smart people to immediately pack up and leave right so I get his vision but at the same time it just is a historically observed fact that like it's really hard to get large percentages of a country to leave right like uh lots of countries around the world just like do things that are like pretty terrible and like pretty traumatic for people and a lot of the time the percent of people that leave is like only a couple of percent right I mean I think you know there are exceptions right and like obviously you know 10 or like 20% of the population of Ukraine has like moved over to other parts of East um Eastern Europe and like I was actually like happy to see the willingness of know like places I know like like Poland and Germany to like be a you know like be a home for people right but which is good um but like that's rare right um and that's uh not the sort of thing that happens by default right like what happens by default is um you know Jews in 1938 getting on boats and fleeing Nazi Germany and visiting five countries and getting rejected in five countries and eventually having the sail back um to you know like a land that ends up occupied by Germany and then they get shipped off to concentration camps anyway right like that's like the base case for this sort of thing is pretty brutal and so they you know the level of challenge that like something like that kind of Grants political Vision has to like overcome to really succeed is like pretty high right um so I think uh whether it but at the same time I think some like zuu style things like they don't have to like go all the way and like succeed at this you know gr's political Vision to be something valuable right like just having mediumsized communities and like possibly even creating the 21st century version of universities and uh you know like helping people be with people whose values are more aligned and creating new homes for people and enabling more cultural experimentation like is itself something that's uh know quite valuable right um and so I think we're along the spectrum of impact this is going to be like we don't know like I'm you know like I'm not the type to just like assume that things are going to take over the world right because I just know that most thing like everyone has that dream but but most things fail at the dream and even the people who succeed at the dream it's always like some 45 degree angle thing away from I you know what they originally intended but uh I guess uh I'm observing and interested and like I hope different people try different versions of this and we'll see what happens and do you plan to make Z on a regular basis do you plan anything for the next year this is still being talked about but I think a lot of people are hoping for um you know to see something and like even if um you know the kind of you know like quote officials or solo group never does anything like as I mentioned like me in Thailand already exists right and I think it's a form factor that will probably take on a big life of its own even you know like going far beyond what happened this year mhm and can you tell us about maybe some books which you read within the last year which inspired you it's an interesting question um I've uh been in the last year definitely had done less books and more like reading blogs and and things on the internet and I mean obviously like things like podcasts and like even know like science fiction um I think like I know histo like maybe 10 years ago I mean like I read a lot of uh the kind of you know the Austrian economics literature and like you know things like human action but also things like the Moon is a Harsh Mistress it's like this novel by Robert heinlin about a society that like creates a civilization on the moon and tries to gain independence um much more recent I uh oh um I watched like some of the there's this the the three body problem um I I read like part of the novel and I also watched like part of the TV series and I was just fascinated by that because it uh it just really like it presents its world and it presents its worldview in a way that is just like totally different from things that we're used to um and it's you know like useful to I think you know like think about those things and you know I think like there's uh there's aspects to the world viiew that gets presented there that I disagree with right like there's always this kind of mentality of like oh the world is super dangerous and like basically the five big countries have to get together and fig and figure things out and like no one else gets a see it at the table and you know like that's like not the kind of world that I want that not the kind of mentality that I want to you know like see yet bigger but there's this aspect of you know just appreciating the know the vastness of the universe and just you know like how lucky humanity is you know have been born and sort of how um you know significant and how small we are at the same time and other people uh who you admire who inspire you um I think um a lot of uh PE there's like specific aspects e he has a Blog called eser codex and Astro codex 10 like it's not a book but his posts are so long they're basically like like the equivalent of reading 10 books um and he just does a very good job of like making really important philosophical Concepts understandable and like talking about just all kinds of things and I mean know like science and politics and I'm you know like deep ways other people have told me that my writing style is uh kind of inspired by his um I think I mean I kind of have to say I think in ziny I appreciate his you know like just soft power leadership and know like his ability to just you know like be a figure that kind of rallies and in and like inspires people in um you know like that way right like just you know like not just giving out the orders but just you know like being the face and you know really rallying people behind the cause um then see me El owski I think alongside Scott Alexander the two of them are kind of similar characters in a lot of ways there's like a collection of different intellectuals that I admire just for their ability to basically stay sane over the last 10 years when so many other people have gone insane um there is um also within the uh ethereum Community um and just a lot of diff a lot of the different researchers for their ability to kind kind of step up and just do really interesting things like know like Justin Drake like Dad um shwe um a the foundation's executive director um who really pushed the philosophy of subtraction the just the different you know like people who have you know like really kind of stepped up and kind of sort of made a you know a piece of ethereum of their own and just like really put their souls into just like making that piece as great as possible so who the most influential people you met left the most impression on you like mention Steve can tell more about me as him and some other people really impressed by yeah I Steve wak is definitely like one of the famous people I've met where I was impressed by them and like my impression of them did not reduce after meeting them right like he was just a a genuinely fascinating guy who just like had really interesting hobbies and like a lot of uh really cool things that he was able to tell me about um he actually gave me his business card and it was this um you know real this kind of very thin metal thing that's like even um you know kind of usable as a pocket knife if you have nothing else and I just thought that's uh you know really cool um also from you know governments um Audrey Tong the taiwan's digital Minister I think was also a good example of this um like she just had just all kinds of interesting ideas of her own and he has she has her own history of uh the uh um being involved in you know taiwan's um know democracy movement and then gov zero which is trying to know create a kind of more democratic know e-government kind of infrastructure for Taiwan um then um like new Prime new prime minister of Montenegro spich Mickey um I know like met him and I'm just also impressed by know like from what I can tell his know dedication to making the country better and also just being a curious you know like person who was like willing to talk to me and willing to learn things about crypto um he also spent many years in East Asia and he knows like some Chinese and some Japanese actually spent spent a b bunch of time in Singapore too um see yeah I think uh those would be definitely some of the names and how do you see the crypto adoption in different countries where they see the most activity in both in terms of regulations and in terms of people adopting and this technology so for the last one and a half months I've been in basically East and Southeast Asia and I've been impressed by how much progress there has been here like I remember five years ago they had exchanges and they had uh mining but in terms of like research for example there was basically nothing interesting happening in like all the longitudes between t in San Francisco right look now that it's just changed so much like uh with ZK sarks and ZK EVMS there are multiple I you know Chinese ZK rollup projects um well and of course like now a lot of them have a lot of people in in Singapore as well um they're with ERC 4337 and account abstraction like I saw two projects working on ERC 4237 wallets in Taiwan I visited Japan and I talked to some uh people working in Japan actually we discovered that like a huge part of the ethereum foundation's privacy and scaling team is based across East and Southeast Asia and they're just very enthusiastically working on all of these different ideas um then in um you know Singapore there's uh more and more things relocating here obviously and I feel like the level of just that kind of local talent and like understanding on the research side is really improving um in India I had similar Impressions I uh remember on my previous visits there were definitely much less happening but now like I visited Bangalore and I got some like very deep Insight question and questions that like reflected I think a really sophisticated level of knowledge of the technology from people who were in um just asking me things there like there was stuff on zero knowledge proofs um and even like using Hardware to accelerate Z knowledge proofs I you know like stuff on soulbound tokens stuff on all the different details of account abstraction um and like it was a pretty sophisticated discussion and it essed me and is there any special skill you would like you can do now but you would like to learn good question um in terms of uh languages I'd probably want to improve my Spanish more um at some point um I it's uh in ter in terms of um other things I mean I always like want to keep I you know like actually being up to date on like all the different Technologies so like I want to like properly play around with AI more I've done a bit of that and you know like I want to keep you know improving on that side I what other kinds of uh skills are there um I mean I've you know like I've started like doing more hiking and more running recently and I've you know slowly continuing to try getting better at that um I mean know keep keep playing um you know like chess and like playing ghost sometimes want to keep improving those um um also there's like people skills there's you know like things like just like being able to identify I you know like who are the the people that are like most valuable for me to cooperate with and like even um and like being able to like deal with like situations where other people people have conflicts with each other and like they're both trying to involve me in various ways like there's a a lot of kind of diplomacy stuff that I've just like historically not really been good at but that I just end up being thrown in because like everyone wants me to do things and so that's also an area that I want to improve at and do you use CHP or any other AI tools on everyday basis and like can you share which applications to you use and for what purposes so I used the chbt I've also used the stability chat now somewhat now that it's come out I use that for a few things I mean one is just like asking specific questions that I want answers for um one is for like writing code um so I find that the thing that Chad GPT is best at is writing code that uses like apis or libraries or like like tools that you did not really know about right and like it even sometimes can like take natural language tasks and convert them so like for for example if I have a spreadsheet and I wanted to do something like um identify the rows where the uh thing in the third column multiplied by the thing in the sixth column is at least 0.6 and sort those by the thing in the by the thing in the fourth column um and then and then identify all of the items in this other spreadsheet that where the thing in the fourth column is the same as one of the items in the first then like I can describe something like that in English and like thei just writes the code and like usually either it just works immediately or I have to like fix one pretty obvious bug and it just does it right um also for translation I think chbt often uh does better than even Google translate um for helping to learn languages like if I want to understands the grammar behind a particular sentence it does a good really good job of uh doing that um the things that it's less good at are basically things where there aren't like many many millions of examples to learn from right so like very obscure languages chat GPT is pretty terrible at um also using apis that are like a lot of the more obscure ethereum apis like if I tell it for example write code to do something in ethereum without using the web3 library it just is not able to do that it often just keeps using the web3 library even though I tell it not to right so there's a lot of things like that and like I think the more you use chat gbt the more you kind of know where it's good and where it's not good and like you even if you ask it a question and if it gives you an answer like you get an intuitive feeling for like what parts of the answer you can trust and what parts of the answer like you really want to like check over yourself um so yeah those are the things that CH gbt has been good at like it it definitely does increase my productivity by quite a bit um then I mean I use you know like either like stable diffusion or the various other AI drawing things to draw to draw images um and know like I use those images and you know things like my posts and my slides quite a bit um yeah so that has been it so far but uh I mean I'm sure as AI gets better I'll use it in other places as well uh what's your biggest dream that's a good question I feel like I'm not the sort of person to have one dream I'm the sort of person to have you know a lot of dreams right like I yeah you know I mean obviously dream of uh you know like a world where um you know that can be more you know like more free and more open and where the tools that we that we're building in the crypto space can be a big part of uh actually making that happen I you know dream of you know Humanity as a whole really succeeding and you know like ending disease and you know like becoming a multiplanetary civilization um I um you know also just you know dream of both you know myself and all all of the people I care about just you know like having a good and happy life and so I think all of those things I mean know like the larger and the smaller importance to me MH and you mentioned multi civilization so do you think in the future we can travel between the planets and would you take that right to space I think we'll absolutely get there um I think I me I'm not I won't be the first one to go I might be the 100th person to go you know I it's it's interesting like I I I think before we're really ready to do space we we need to get better at doing Antarctica first right like I think of Antarctica as being like kind of like the uh you know the tutorial ground of going to space right because it's a it's an environment that's definitely somewhat harsh and like you have zero infrastructure but you still can like breathe the air without wearing a helmet right and like if you're in the part of the the Western Antarctic Peninsula that's like close to Latin America like you could even um you know like do like take your helmet off and breathe the air in the winter right um so like if we can't like do Antarctica and enjoy Antarctica we're not going to be able to enjoy the moon right um so start with um you know the the simpler things um but uh yeah I mean I yeah would definitely you know like love to like actually be part of that myself at some point over the next few decades and are there any exotic extreme countries you haven't been yet but you would like to visit like an good question yeah I mean anartica is definitely up there um let's see what other exotic extreme countries are there um I mean I I feel like and I've been to sber now and that's the northernmost significant settlement in the world so that's you know pretty exotic in its own way um there's like very far away ocean spots um and you know like things like Galapagos in the eastern island but those kind of feel almost the less interesting than zird um [Music] H yeah it's a good question I mean like I think for me the higher priority is also just like visiting um in the near term definitely wants to go to more places in the Middle East it's kind of the one region that I've relatively ignored um and I think uh well the Middle East is I mean interesting because there's just a a lot of uh definitely a lot of culture there that's like you know like far from things that I've uh and places I've visited so far also definitely a lot of uh really interesting things happening um also uh I think as one of these sort of tutorial levels of going into space I think you know like some of the stuff that's being done in those countries definitely kind of Rises up to a bit of those level right cuz like the climate there is like a Prett PR unforgiving hot desert and a lot of it and like there's a huge amount of know like pretty admirable human Ingenuity that you know goes into taking that and like even trying to make that um you know like really Pleasant and lovable for people um you know like up to 21st century standard and so you know like seeing more of that in person is definitely something I would uh you know love to do too um so yeah that's uh you know also on my list to figure out when I can you know like visit more in the near term um uh place there's like places that I uh totally have somehow have not been to yet that are almost a bit embarrassing like I have not been to the Philippines yet I have not been to the Brazil yet and uh it's you know kind of fill the gaps there too um Mongolia seems fascinating uh but yeah I don't know I mean the the other thing is that like I've also been trying to like decrease the amount of traveling that I do recently and like spend more time getting to like more deeply know a few uh particular places um and so you know I'm definitely not kind of rushing out to go and like spend three days everywhere and you I me I'm trying to kind of be you know like more slow and you know like more deliberate in my I guess both physical exploration and cultural exploration and like you know I get to know specific places better who is your favorite CH player what is your favorite opening good question um favorite chess player that's a um I kind of just want to say Alexandra Bas like I think in addition to just being a good chess player she just know ex seems very fun as a person and I think that's you know always enjoyed the time that I spend with her I think with openings I'm honestly pretty boring like I'm in uh um you you know E4 E5 Knight F3 kind of person um and it's I mean chess has been interesting I think it's uh like it's interesting in how like to me it's a it's a metaphor for so many other kinds of like difficult questions in life right like you know like even questions like uh to what extent do you judge each situation individually and what to what extent you try to stick to principles or like what does it mean to be neutral or to be unbiased right and like if you think about this like you're in the middle of a chess game and you're in the middle of a complicated chess position like and then you realize there is no such thing as the neut chess move or there is no such thing as like a chess move that is obviously not terrible right like there's it's just a hard game where there's just like a high level of um you know like actual skill that's just and like actual um you know combination of I think like principles and situation specific judgment that's just necessary to like even pass at a pretty basic level right like you know you can say things like a queen is worth nine pawns and a rook is worth five and a knight and a bishop are worth three and then you go the next level and then you realize that like wait two Bishops are actually worth more than twice as much as one bishop and like two Bishops are better than two knights but one Knight is better than one Bishop um and then um you start thinking about like oh you know what position are the Pawns in and it you know gets pretty deep pretty quickly and like you start to you know realiz like wait you know the world is like this too right it's you know a land that brings many challenges and look there's unfortunately no simple rule that you can follow to make sure that you're always doing the right thing and like that's just you know part of the challenge that the world brings um so I think that has been fascinating for me the other thing that's fascinating for me is the difference between two-player games and multiplayer games um so like a play chess and go a bunch but then multiplayer games like you know there's saying like sett of Katan is like popular in some you know like friend circles and I've played it a bunch there's others what are the fascinating things about three-player games or multiplayer games that's different from two-player games is that in a three-player game in a surprisingly large class of situations the weakest player is actually the one who's most likely to win right and like there's some specific scenarios where we can even mathematically prove this right but uh basically the reason why is like actually pretty simple right it's because the the first best player is the most afraid of the second the second best is most afraid of the first and so the top two kill each other and so the third has a surprisingly good opening to kind of hide a bit and succeed right and then the other one is like in Advantage at the beginning does not necessarily mean that you win right like in chess if you just like eat the other guy's Queen on on the fourth move you've basically won unless you do something really horrible later right but in something like settlers of Katan if you're like we points you know Bridges or whatever ahead of everyone else within three moves so like everyone else gangs up against you and like you often end up losing right uh so this is like it's interesting to me because like I've written a lot about you know like coin voting governance and like fundamental challenges of of governance um and you know like uncoordinated and coordinated games and like one of the things that I independently realized is that there are thing results that you can prove about the two-person case to make the two person case really clean but then the results like once you try to translate those results to even the threers case they just completely break and you have total chaos and instability and like I think the difference between something like chess and something like s of Katan is like actually surprisingly similar in that way so I find that a fascinating metaphor too great analytics thank you for such interesting conversation great to have you yeah thank you too I know it's good to be here",

    "content": "[Music] Hi cartic how are you I am a little bit tired but overall great so cartic it's been uh like how many years of eth global now um seven years 130 events yeah so so how was your general impression of Defcon this week I actually really enjoyed the fact that this was a developer focused Community this time around and I feel like we've seen it a bunch of different waves mhm and this time it kind of gives me the same 2017 2018 Vibes and that was a moment where people were actually excited about making the protocol better and uh I actually found that refreshing I think I I think I felt the same way amazing well that was my first question to you too um my math says you have done 26 different talks this week is that right or is there more I me to one minute count now um do you count okay do you count talks or do you count like events that I've been to okay maybe talks is simpler um okay so hold on 2 + 2 + 11 okay that's 15 then that was before Devcon then okay during deathcon what was that the First first day hour was like I think it was like three plus 4 plus uh 3 plus three so about 13 so that gets us to 28 and then I still have like I think like one more soon 30 that's a very busy schedule what were some of your favorite moments from uh that whole week um DC day was fun uh so that was uh yesterday so that was uh it was it was really amazing to like actually see that whole Community come together and people who are doing a really fascinating bioscience together with people working on computer security together with people working on uh prediction markets and neurotech and like all of those different concepts all come just uh come together and like actually function as uh one community and uh like just also just seeing the progress in all of those individual Fields so that was really impressive the very beginning of uh Devan I uh I mean especially the opening um part the like I felt like the choice of just like putting so many anime themes in there was just like perfect like that's the that's the etherum I know exactly yeah yeah awesome um well maybe maybe let's go into some of the stuff that I know the rest of the Internet's been talking about and that is uh Justin Drake's talk okay so what I'm kind of curious about is what do you as vitalic think about beam chain so I think um almost all of the ideas in there are like basically correct right and they're like basically very similar to things that have been talked about in the ethereum research space for quite a while right I know they're right in my uh roadmap documents that I've published I think uh the two places where I would uh uh either disagree or at least Express uncertainty on substance are one is short slat times so I worry about short slat times because I think it would hurt like it risks hurting uh both like um fairness toward people in geographically non- Central locations it's like even if theoretically you can optimize the loop down so that theoretically someone who is based in Latin America or southeast Asia or orano or New Zealand can participate in creating a block if it's the case said the yeah it they still suffer like a lot like even like 10 or 20% incentive wise than like even if they can they won't right and so I think uh like for that reason you actually want to be a lot more careful and also you want to be robust against potential breakdown in in uh internet communications you want to be uh robust against potentially a rise in censorship and like other kinds of active attacks against the chain and so I don't think that the ethereum L1 should like over optimize and say like okay the Earth's like half circumference is 20,000 kilm that divided by the speed of light is 67 milliseconds times three rounds of communication therefore the L1 should have 200 M second block times right that's like the kind of uh thinking where like uh okay like I think this seem to lab trolls people on Twitter way too much and Eagles over but if you do that you're like say the word fragile at you 500 and you will deserve every single one of them right so I think ethereum needs to be way more cautious than that that's like one piece and then the not to say that I think 12 seconds lot times are optimal right I think we should just do the research and it's and we're not sure yet how far we can go and then the other thing is like the trade-off between uh doing it all at once versus doing it more incrementally and I think we should like start the work and then uh figure out over time the what the right approach is I think I mean I saw there has been a lot of criticism of the beam chain but it's not like criticism of the beam chain as the beam chain it's criticism of this uh like perception and I think realistically misperception miscommunication that the beam chain is ethereum 3.0 and basically like everyone is the thing that that everyone is supposed to put their hopes on is that this is this specific set of redesigns that will come in 2029 and that's like not true at all right so even even within the beam chain road map like huge numbers of things like dank sharting you know expected to come 20125 2026 uh so the thing that matters for users in terms of scale will come much sooner and also like the entire beam chain road map is just consensus layer right so aside from consensus layer ethereum is also execution layer so that includes the evm there's a whole other road map for upgrading the evm then you have layer 2s then you have cross layer 2 and there's whole other road map for upgrading the Crossway 2 situation then you have wallets and then today actually about 15 minutes ago the cave team showed me how they like fully integrated social recovery and even ZK email recovery and so you know there's like a whole road map for like doing the like wallet ux on both the convenience and the security side so the consensus uh part of ethereum is like less than a quarter of everything in ethereum is up that is being upgraded and there's just so many other parts that are moving way faster than a 5year timeline that are extremely relevant to developers and users so so a few followup questions by the way this is a great actually Ure to understand again of what are the misconceptions here yeah um my understanding is this 5-year timeline is a conservative estimate uh but I mean I think it's uh actually a reasonable or maybe even slightly aggressive set of estimates for the full set of things that Justin wants to do you just have to remember that like 2029 is the timeline for Nirvana and even a quarter of Nirvana is like incredibly useful right and like the things that users need are just are come much much sooner than like the completion of the entire vision and this is effectively clarifying that yeah you can't you're not waiting for the five years to the whole thing as a massive single push these are all parts where you actually get to the Finish Line when the last one is confirmed a years down the road um what is the differentiation between the part that beam chain focuses on and the parts that we're already outlined in the road map that you've outlined before because we're effectively not the right word but cherry-picking certain things and prioritizing those over the rest of the plan is is that a fair way to think about it how kind of does that relate to the rest of the road map and does this mean that we are going to be less focused on finishing the rest of this I would say absolutely not I mean I would say ethereum right now is very good at parallelizing right and so there is a team that is working on statelessness there is a team that is working on evm upgrades there is a team that is working on me issues right there's a huge amount of Paralis that's happening already and so I definitely do not expect that Justin is going to like pull away researchers who would otherwise be giving us like vergal trees or starked binary trees that's like just not how this ecosystem works at all all um I I mean I think actually the higher more likely possibility is that this road map is going to be able to pull in people into the specking process who would otherwise not be able to participate at all just like how the beacon chain like pulled in an entire set of client devs who were not part of client Dev at all before right um so I think like that's a really Justin's goal um I think like all of the other things that are happening are still happening and there are huge um sets of developers that are and huge constituencies that will benefit greatly from each of those things happening that are putting huge uh amounts of resources into making them happen so I definitely don't view it at all as being competitive okay um one thing that I also saw this week MH on the internet M was uh a lot of smaller but and some bigger arguments around the lack of focus that they're seeing from cevs and ether Foundation it's and it's a it's a very interesting thing because there were a lot of arguments around it but there was not a lot of justification or or explanation but the part that I do actually want to talk about is one comment was from U from John chano saying that it's actually not clear that the ethereum cevs actually agree on what the product is and just the way you kind of answered the question just now implies that Justin has his own version of what the the next set of prioritization should be and and you have a different sort of opinion and a few other people may have a different version is this is this coordinated is that what it feels like how do you kind of address these types of comments I mean look like Bitcoin has that exact same problem but even more so like bit like do you think everyone in Bitcoin agrees on opcat right do you think everyone in Bitcoin agrees on what even comes after opcat it's uh like having internal difference of opinion is not a failure mode it is a decentralized pluralistic ecosystem right and like no ethereum is not taking the iPhone approach like uh if uh that's what you want there's uh plenty of uh other blockchains for you and there's and realistically there's plenty of uh things that that that offer far more scale and far lower latency than blockchains that are for you right so so then tell us why that is actually not something you want to go do as ethereum and and why does it matter that we have this approach to building software yeah I mean I think okay so one other thing that I think is important right is that what ethereum is with respect to developers I actually think is incredibly clear right so ethereum is the world computer layer one is the trust machine it's the anchor it holds everything together it holds high value applications that really depend on it and ler two is the GPU it provides speed and impr provide scale and uh that includes a a very heterogeneous a combination of uh rollups and other systems that have all kinds of speed and scale trade-offs for for all kinds of different applications like that is uh what ethereum is and it and basically it's the vision that it's been going for all the way since 20120 right I mean I think uh there is the separate question of like what do people think is the economic model of e the asset and I think the challenge there is like there's this weird magnifying glass on eth as though eth has this like much greater responsibility to answer this question than everyone else when like the reality is like what is the okay look like Doge Doge went up by like what like 40% 50% the last two days why did it go up it went up I think because Elon and Trump and like Co announced that they're making a department of government efficiency like okay first you have a coin and the coin had value because it had a dog now you have a coin and the coin hasue because there's a a government Department named after a dog okay so like explain this in the lingo of like PE ratios and like discounted cash flows and like anything that's intelligible to a finance professor at a university right or even Bitcoin right remember remember how back in 2019 Bitcoin had the stock to flow model and like it's it's like you know you you take the like flow rate which is like the number of Bitcoins being issued and then divided by stock and then you rate is and you or you like invert that and you raise it to the power of 3.3 and then basically it's like the guy figured out that this is the model that like perfectly fits bitcoin's up or no it was the 463 day moving average of that is the thing that perfectly fits bitcoin's price up to that and then it's like basically the the year after the stock to flow model got like accepted and beloved by everyone in the Bitcoin Community it basically stopped working right and then if you look at the charts like actually it's like the Bitcoin price started going up at exactly the time when the 463 day EMA stock to flow stopped moving up right and so it's like basically the whole thing is just like completely stupid and like the like half the Bitcoin influencer class like actually belied it for a couple of years right and so the I think the conclusion is like nobody freaking has a clue how these things are valued and this isn't an ethereum problem this is not even a crypto problem like honestly yeah this is just how crowds behave irrationally exactly right it's like the world is just a fundamentally incredibly chaotic place where there's even today a huge amount of things that we uh know very little about and we are constantly learning and uh to me the benefit of eth as an asset is that it's at the center of this very Diversified ecosystem that has uh and so basically it has exposure to to a whole range of different applications and like to use a very cringe word you know thesis right so you know it like there's multiple flavors of layer 2s there's layer one applications there is people using eth as collateral in a bunch of applications and you basically need like any one of these succeed for it to do well but I think one push back I'll give you here is that I don't think it's a binary choice right it's not like well we don't want to be the the Apple here and dictate every single aspect of what the features should be we also don't want to be well everybody can figure out what they want we'll kind of collectively address if they agree or not um yeah kind of from that perspective why is it important to take the approach that leans towards not being fully in know victorial about the decision- making of how we improv the protocol uh but separately why are we not making the layer one faster I me I think uh the reason not to just bump up the keep bumping up the gas limit is that like decentralization is one of those things that once you lose it's hard to get it back and the ethereum community actually has a track record of getting it back but every time you see a centralization stat or a censorship stat improving behind that stat are like hundreds of hours of sweating tears of like Danny and Justin giving of impassioned phone calls to like all kinds of different ecosystem actors you have um all kinds of people talking to each other you have like Evan vaness and friends like making a very loud case of like something on Twitter you have just like all kinds of different people um fighting really really hard to try to push the ecosystem toward a more decentralized equilibrium and like sometimes uh there actually are successes right and but on the other hand like slipping from more uh decentralization to more centralization is something that's easy right and uh I think the risk is right that is basically that if you look at the end game right the end game is that we want 100,000 transactions a second right and on the L1 no the end game is said we want 100,000 transaction a second we now the 100,000 transactions a second cannot live on the L1 because if they live like an L1 that can actually directly run 100,000 transactions a second like that there is just no way to run that on a node at the same time as having a decentralized network right the only like basically the only approach that you can like basically ends up looking like um what we call enshrined rollups and and like that actually is one of the long-term ideas that's being considered right but like doing it directly like there's no way to do that that's not centralizing and so the risk is that if we take a halfway house approach and we say okay well instead of doing 15 TPS on L1 and say 985 TPS on on L2 we're going to do let's say like 60 TPS on L1 and 940 TPS on L2 the risk is that well you've actually uh significantly centralized the L1 and what have you gotten well instead of 98% of activity being on on L2 you have 94% of activity being on al2 right and so I think like this is one of those things right where know if you go in that direction sometimes it's easy to to make it in response to AE a knee-jerk judgment but then like you have to be really clear about you know like what you aim to get and like what what risks you're taking right and so I personally like I I do support L1 increasing in scale and I do support both uh you know moderate gas limit increases evm repricings introduction of entirely new features like evm Max and simd that could greatly accelerate evm computation of specific operations um like be very beneficial to l2s and to L1 based privacy protocols right but I think this is something that should happen like reasonably and at a gradual Pace right and uh at the same time as L2 scaling can happen very aggressively so is decentralization in this example and just in this kind of decision making purely the ability for some any individual to just run with the same specs and and assuming that that the hardware requirements are accessible is that kind of the only axis that we're we're looking at so one is is uh number of distinct people who run nodes another is number of uh both solo stakers and even smaller medium Enterprise stakers that are like actually staking um so you have those stats right and again this is one of those things where it's not about capability it's about incentive right in the sense that like a lot of the time people say things like oh you know you can buy an 18 like a a 20 terabyte hard drive for like half a, doar or whatever the the number is right and like therefore requiring 20 terabytes of storage is actually not that bad right but that's the wrong metric the metric is you don't want running a node to be possible you want running a node to be easy enough that it's a thing that people consider doing by default right um and uh the challenge is basically that if running a node becomes more costly then even if it's theoretically possible people get lazy people start um aggregating all over their nodes and basically we all like have trusting one operator to do everything and like that like that itself starts this slide toward an ecosystem where you have a relatively small number of actors that are actually interpreting the rules and once you have a relatively small number of actors that are interpreting the rules that means you have a relatively small number of actors that need to be convinced to change the rules and so from the perspective of someone building an application that needs to last like 5 or 10 years or even from the perspective of someone building a layer two right the thing that you want out of out of the layer one is robustness the thing you want out of the layer one is that you want something that is going to be what what it promised to be right and I think that's something that's uh really valuable for ethereum L1 just like for bit Bitcoin L1 to really yeah take seriously and not be willing to give up asily that that makes a lot of sense and and I think U have a couple followup questions there but I'm not going to do that because uh that'll be a personal tangent that I I going into the thing I'm kind of curious about is how does this tie into the L2 road map so is kind of the bet that let's make everything happen on the l2s because we are agreeing to the lay ones being more scalable over time but want to paralyze that so that eventually we can absorb this or is it that actually you think delegation transactions is important to be on l2s and the layer one should be mostly just aggregating and rolling up instead of actually storing the raw hundreds of thousands of transactions if you ever get to that world I me I I could definitely see certain types of high value activity continuing to be on L1 for quite a while right and uh I think if uh me potentially that could even continue into the long term we will see right the uh I me I think there's uh a lot of different long-term end games I do think it makes sense for at least some amount of uh activity to continue to be on L2 even in a long-term future where L1 like adds something like like native rollups right and uh I think like that one's true for two reasons right one of those reasons is that like even if L1 adopts native rollups I think realistically C Dev would wants to do it in a way that is minimally opinionated and and in a way that like gives developers maximum flexibility and so it'll be done in a way that like basically makes it easy for even existing l2s and like even based rollups to just slot themselves into the frame work and just continue to function so that's one part and then another part is that I see the like valid room for two different kinds of Els right like one kind that is uh focuses more on decentralization and boim home security and uh like inheriting the properties of1 as much as possible and I also see the room for l2s that focus on maximum scale that focus on maximum speed and they give things like latency pre-confirmation way more data than ethereum like data availability will be will be willing to offer and those kinds of things are just inherently not going to be native rollups right those kinds of things are inherently going to be al2 and so that's a niche that I think will continue to persist even into the longterm future and it's going to have a lot of applications on it is is it okay to accept single points of failures for these l2s because some of them will make these compromises for higher latency or faster through but uh not settle as fast and you kind of do those trade-offs H what's a good framework for understanding why you should just be defaulted to all the l2s and uh and how to think about that growing yeah I mean so I think I mean if you're an application that does not demands a low latency then it just makes sense to be on an L2 that uh offers higher levels of decentralization if you're on if you are an application that does demand very low latency then I do think that we as an ecosystem need to have a more rigorous discipline of like figuring out what what like what fallback me mechanisms actually are realistic right because right now the theory that we have so far basically says okay you're on an L2 it has a centralized sequencer if the central sequence starts being bad you can exit right but like what does exiting actually mean right if you have like say you know you have like e Frontier right like Eve on Line's new thing and let's say it becomes nl2 that is a low latency optimized well let's say if servers disappear and you want to mass exit what does it actually mean right well like how would users like actually migrate to some kind of new provider that would actually keep the game running for them right like that's an open question or another one is in some cases you have this idea that well if the sequencer goes bad you have a governance mean mechm that can change the sequence if that happens well what would that governance mechanism actually look like would it actually try to detect like say abuse if it does how do you actually detect M abuse is this something that can be automated um or another example is like from an application perspective a lot of the time what you're worried about is you're not worried about like actual theft you're worried about vendor lockin and so if an L2 start starts becoming thater lockin toward you and let's say L2 even makes a a governance upgrade right like imagine an L2 does something where they start suddenly introducing a wealth tax into their system but they go through the governance upgrade Channel they have a 30-day delay it satisfies a St Sho definition technically everyone can exit but like actually can the collective set of users of an application like actually coordinated do an exit right and like I do think our ecosystem like really needs a rigorous discipline of like think through those issues and like actually even War gaming some of them and figuring out like what could users and application developers collectively do in that kind of situation well I hope uh we don't get to see those situations often but we still need a way to think about addressing them yeah absolutely I mean I think I mean in dydx V3 I think shut down a few days ago right and like we actually saw some Mass exits uh come out of that and that seems pretty orderly but like that was users on an application specific roll up right I think the big test is what happens when an application needs to mass exit right it's like imagine if let say polygon became an a proper stage two L2 and poly Market was still on polygon but then polygon would had suddenly uh you say it had a 30-day uh window for governance updates and someone bought up half the polygon token and they said okay we're making a governance upgrade and the governance upgrade says we're going to grab all theone in poly Market can poly Market as an application Mass exit what does that actually mean right like when something like any kind of instance of an application Mass exiting happens well I I think that would be the next big test for the ethereum ecosystem to pass I think that's a very interesting world to see uh how you kind of design applications this way especially as we see a bigger set of contracts going to be getting deployed as actually uh immutable um wow um I do want to change topics a little bit I want to go back to one interesting announcement that we heard from the kickoff at at Decon and that was kind of the the spin out or kind of the formation of Argo Collective where solidity Fay uh sourcify all of the the teams were kind of moving over to a new nonprofit and the big question I have is um why is that transition happening and and why is that now part of etherum foundation especially when you have pretty core features of the protocol being worked on by these teams uh does it make sense to create a separation yeah and so the E theum Foundation has uh you know for a long time like followed this uh philosophy of subtraction right and the way that I think about it is that the ethereum foundation's mission is not to grow the ethereum foundation the ethereum foundation's mission is to grow the Civil Society of ethereum even if needed at the at the expense of the ethereum foundation and event at the of like potentially 100% of The Ether found existence right and so not necessarily but potentially right and uh the reason why this is important right is that like if you think if you take the analogy to politics right A lot of the time one of the ways in which like very centralized forms of government like very totalitarian ones end up arising is when you have something that collapses uh but then you don't have a strong Civil Society like that that is able to take on the r and uh what we mean by Civil Society is like basically something other than either the centralized organ or profit motivated actors right if you don't have a civil society then like basically you end up collapsing into just having profit motivated actors and then that itself is a very centralizing game and then like very quickly you end up just like sliding into yet another equilibrium where you have either like some kind of very centralized scenario or you have something more chaotic where the end result again is a very centralized scenario right and so if he wants to avoid that situation having a strong Civil Society like having a strong decentralized body of uh actors that is uh like that has a strong tradition of acting together as an ecosystem and that is motivated by goals other than profit maximization like basically is the kind of social immune system that can actually make an ecosystem resilient right and so the goal of the foundation is basically making that ethereum has that right and so the philosophy makes sense but I think the question is how do you going to think about the execution now you're going to create this dependency of if they want to grow they need to figure out additional funding or now somebody else can approach them and that may create a whole new set of incentives to prior to something else H how does that work when we kind of think about something as critical solidity yeah I mean so I think we need to acknowledge that there is an unsolved problem here right and uh you know even the ethereum foundation right does not have an infinite Lifetime right and uh like the to be clear like the amount of funding that we're planning to give argot is like it's not like two year two years and then ask again all funding it's like endowment level funding right it's meant to be smaller than EF but in principle equal longevity to EF as a an ethereum institution right and so I think in terms of like solidity longevity right like that happening inside of inside of argot it does not make the problem worse but it does still leave open the fact that there is this open question in terms of longevity and I think the way that I think about this actually is that I do think that there is an actual open problem that I do acknowledge within the ethereum ecosystem which is basically that I think there's like a lack of uh like medium scale um and and of hybrid like nonprofit and for-profit funding models right basically like what often happens is that if you have a bright new public good idea that has no business model whatsoever but it's like clearly public good in a way that a lot of people in the ecosystem recognize there are plenty of actors that will give you a $100,000 Grant there's actors that will give you a $300,000 Grant or even $500,000 Grant the problem is that once you go from like $300,000 demo size to 30 million doll production size your incentive basically swishes from like so full socialist Garden of Eden the good people take care of you all the way into full capitalist your only source of funding comes from fully profit motivated actors right and so you basically go from like Garden of Eden all the way into you know the jungle right and like the like this is like a very rapid shift and like I think it is an unhealthy Dynamic that this rapid shift exists right and so so I do think that the ecosystem will be more healthy if we actually do see like more of these entity more mechanisms that are in the middle more mechanisms that do have some way of getting profit do have some way of returning Capital to investors even growing Capital but for at the same time which are willing to make some level of sacrifices and uh to take a principled stance in terms of supporting ethereum alignment and supporting ethereum values supporting open source Open Standards decentralization passing the walkway test like being positive some toward ethereum positive some toward the world and like all of these different things that we care about right and like I think yeah like making a figuring that out is uh still an open problem and that's something that I'm willing to acknowledge no that makes a lot of sense and as as I kind of as you say this I feel like the closest thing I've seen similar to this is actually the Mozilla Foundation and uh they kind of do both sides of this and you kind of still get to see amazing impr is interesting right in that it's like both a success story but then it's also a bit of a capture story because like their main customer is basically Google right and like you know like auctioning off that like SE chent slot so it's uh I mean I think these are all like great examples to learn from right and then I think for each one you want to like understand the successes and understand the failures and ideally come up with something I mean this is also one of the reasons why why you know I think we want to have this distributed ecosystem right because like it's okay if each individual entity ends up having a business model that has a problem as long as the problems all Go in different directions and so like that instead of being additive the problem is so like cancel each other out or at least like insure against each other yeah it's going to be a pretty long experiment to figure out what what works and what doesn't which is actually exciting abely absolutely it's exciting for me too um want to talk about a couple more things before we wrap things up one is something that we've kind of seen become more and more prominent over the last few weeks and and especially this year that is the role crypto has played in politics uh you recently made a comment that uh kind of being leveraging crypto to uh effectively prioritize certain government official elections is not something kind of you what you signed up for maybe buer in the direct quote but uh we've kind of seen a lot of these things happen um we've seen a lot of uh positive and negative outcomes and I'm kind of curious about kind of what you think now the role crypto plays in uh the world of politics whether it's us or the rest of the world and uh you going to have any different thoughts nowadays yeah I mean I think it uh it's it's playing a very different uh roles and I think often like very invisible roles in all kinds of different ways right I think even the ideas coming out of crypto are already Upstream of a huge number of different things uh but uh obviously the thing that we saw this year right I mean I think two things right one is like just uh as an application like I think polygon was uh or poly Market on polygon on on ethereum was uh a very net Val valuable um you know contributor to the US info ecosystem and I think in general like it did help people be more informed about what's going on both uh with with regard to the election and even with regard to things that are happening or could happen within within each party right and like that's to me like an example of like the positive side right which is like applications that actually show sort of the spirit of decentralization which is making things that are useful and that provide valuable information to people without relying on centralized Elite that gets to pred decide like what is true and false and what is good and bad on behalf of everyone else but then on the other hand we definitely are seeing this phenomenon that like crypto is turning into this big pool of money and the big pool of money is basically acting as this like big thing that is often sending a message that basically says like you do what we want or else and I think there is something unhealthy to that right like I do think that there is something unhealthy to the idea of like this problem exists without even crypto this is this happens all the time in general it's like it definitely is you know the game that lots of big money actors are trying to play right but uh you know it's like the kind of a game where even if you know you come in in stage one um and then like stage one of the game feels like you want a thing and it feels like you got a thing but the more you get into the loop then like basically instead of um you know like becoming an actor that's providing an alternative to the machine you're basically becoming an actor that's like actually reinforcing those exact same Loops right and potentially yeah reinforcing the like the exact same mechanisms and and uh like also if you're choosing politicians based on you know like how good they are for like crypto as an industry that comes at the expense of uh choosing politicians based on how good they are for other things that people care about and even like the underlying values of crypto it's just it's like one of those games where even if you come in well intentioned it's just like incredibly easy I think to con keep convincing yourself that that you're doing the right thing and then eventually from the uh next generation's perspective like you actually do become the thing that ever that uh people start to agree as like part of the center of power that needs to be rebelled against and that's like something that I hope that we as an EOS system can like preempt and like try to be better then and the fact that uh you may think this is what you're optimizing for but it's a multiplayer game and uh yes this gets complicated and chaotic very fast no multiplayer games are indeed incredibly chaotic and Incredibly complex I think uh people often think of Politics as a tug of war I mean no like politics is a Whirlpool like a huge percentage of the time the outcome of your actions is uh not like not even in the same direction as the uh direction in which you're originally pulling right like sometimes you pull in a particular direction and you create a backlash that makes the situation even worse sometimes you pull in a particular direction and uh someone joins your faction and that person uses 8 billion dollar of stolen customer funds to pull in the same direction and as a result people start like hating that entire direction for for for like a decade even and like even the bits that like actually I think are reasonable and correct and like it's this incredibly chaotic system and like you have to like basically ask the question like are you contributing signal or are you contributing noise and I do think that if you just come in as a relatively naive actor it's like very easy to think that you're contributing signal but like actually be contributing noise or like even worse no up yes or like even even worse than noop like be basically being a thing that just gets like co-opted by whoever the highest bidder is yeah which sucks because now yeah you made that so more accessible with crypto and uh that means you create these short-term outcomes that are yeah worse um H are there other things that uh you're spending time on Beyond just scaling ethereum and your role at the foundation uh what else interests you H so right before I was in uh Bangkok for Defcon I was in changai for six weeks and uh the Zulu popups were happening there right and so this was uh like probably day facto sort of the second round of the experiments right so the first round was in Montenegro last year and then there were a lot of little ones but this time it was uh about like 10 of them all running in parallel and all independently organized I would say roughly half and all in changai yeah all in changai I mean there's actually also Zoo Thailand which is happening very close to Bangkok right after Defcon so that's also one but these were in changai about half a thousand people all in close proximity to each other a lot of ethereum people um and uh it was really impressive to see the community grow to see the community like actually function to start to see the concept of these pop-up cities finds product Market fit to also start to see interest in a lot of these ethereum adjacent topics really start to continue also diak which was this meme that came out of this post that I wrote back at the end of last year so combining together ethereum together with uh computer security technology and physical resilience and biod defense like that whole bundle of topics so at Defcon as I mentioned at the beginning we had a diac day and we had speakers from all those uh top areas present and that seemed really successful and so DC is really turning into this uh very coherent thing and it does feel like I know out of like there's like about five or 10 different product Market fits for uh uh pop-up cities and one of the like I think building Network effects for a lot of uh crypto applications that would otherwise not find a network effects on their own is one of them and I think finding Network effects for DC application and the as even like synergistically witht salons and for ethereum I think is definitely one of them what's an example of a DC application that uh is immediately useful or beneficial to people and how can we think about Network effects here um so I think uh to name one in each category um one uh would be a hardware um ethereum Hardware device um so like actually maximizing the security with which you can with which you can access ethereum and I think uh the reason why that would be valuable to do in a pop-up context is is so that you can actually like build something and then push it out in the context of a community where you can actually try like Community related uh use cases um one thing that was at Edge city is there was a cursive which was a live use of fhe to help pairs of people identify common interests and so you can actually try these use cases live and then get feedback and then iterate on them so that's the computer um um security side then on the info defense side like Collective governance use cases and like truth seeking type of applications even prediction markets all of that could be useful inside of popups on the biod defense side just making popups safe against Airborne diseases making popups environments where it's easy to have a very healthy culture um making popups uh environments that are very uh conducive to just like everything that it takes uh to be uh to to maximize your your longevity uh popups has a vehicle for testing out Technologies for physical resilience like people have been interested in actually doing modular construction like other kinds of physical technology inside of them so like all of those things are possible like basically anything that involves physical world um coordination um and anything that actually like benefits from coordination and and a tight feedback loop of coordination between developers and users I think is something that is a potential pop-up City application awesome um actually that's super cool and I think we all get to watch the the de from Devcon so we get to catch up on all the new things that are being tried out and experimented with uh this is a developer focused event so my last question to you is actually giving us sort of a a a more focused preview of uh what we can expect on the protocol side of things uh this is a very broad generic question but obviously given the the recent blog post you published the book that people got to uh to win today um I want to kind of condense this into a a shorter time frame which is can you give us an idea for what we can expect on the layer one side or any of the SC road map in the next two years and two only I mean I think maybe one like related question that would be good to answer is like what are the basically the valuable toys for hackers here to play with um so one example is EIP 7702 so this is uh the an EIP that's making it into the next hard Fork that is going to uh Bas um provide a lot of convenience and usability benefits to EAS that will like put them on the same track as smart contract buets and there are like Dev Nets and test NS that are doing 7702 today and so 7702 is absolutely ready for people to hack with so that's one good example number two blobs so we're going to see blob count increases and well thanks to P do um and uh other Technologies over the next couple of years and so building on top of blobs um building like both layer 2os as well as other kinds of uh blob based applications like I saw some I think it was like CH Joo and Phil Diane like both had different like apps that would basically put like some kind of like dap interfaces onto blobs so a lot of like interesting applications like that um I guess that was a example to um also not a call future but ZK rappers of everything so ZK email ZK government ID um ZK like web 2 with TLS notary um ZK like some of everything right um and I think you like this stuff has use cases in Social recovery and like multisig wallets it also has use cases in identity and reputation systems uh so that stuff that I think is uh really valuable to work with also cross L2 interoperability so again not part of L1 but coming soon and there are things to is that a comment on just we want to see more of or you're saying there's actually improvements happening but I want to see more of so one example of something that I think someone can build on today take an existing open source wallet Fork it make it support EIP 7683 make it support um chain specific addresses and so you're able to like copy and paste chain specific addresses and then it if you paste in an address that is on a different L2 from where you currently are then it just automatically routes your transfer through a NC 7683 intent based uh exchange and then also use Helios and laula light clients for L1 and for L2 um you could do a mockup of moving um L2 configs onto L1 and turnning turning the main ASMR contracts and then support the version of chain specific address as the routes through that um like basically the enre set of features that is currently being thought about like basically take them put them into a wallet or even put them into two wallets and then get them to talk to each other like that's a hackathon idea right there that I think would be really valuable um then maybe two years away stateless clients um not sure if there's anything that's like worth building on right now what does that unlock huh what do stat list clients unlock they unlock basically they make it much easier for users to run nodes that verify the chain which is valuable both for stakers and for users um okay light clients for L1 and for L2 so Helios basically take that and just like integrate that into wallets and I mentioned this but it's like also really important um evm Max and simd I'm hoping we can get this uh within the next couple of years and you can actually Implement a lot of stuff much more efficiently with that also a project um privacy protocols continue to be important um what other good things are coming over um I'm just trying to like go through the feature list um and there's definitely like staking stuff that you can do on top of single SWOT finality um or even on top of the orbit you also talked about reducing the uh the minimum saking requirements the same window I think it's I definitely want it to be considered um yes um yeah I mean I think those were the big things those are pretty good things yeah andrin counter abstraction another one so e771 but yeah okay that yeah that's the list a lot of goods that you can actually play with right now which is actually awesome so the biggest hackathon here in the world it's going to be a good fun weekend for all the hackers balic thank you so much for this amazing conversation please give him a big round of applause thank you [Music]",

    "content": "Albert is a town called longan it has a population of about 3,000 its latitude is 78° north but interestingly enough the climate is a somewhat less inhospitable than it seems right because uh basically that entire region like all of Scandinavia benefits hugely from the Gulf Stream and and the Gulf Stream makes uh all of those regions significantly warmer than like lots of stuff at comparable latitude if you look at say tromo a city in Norway 69 degrees latitude the lowest temperatures there are like actually not much worse than the lowest temperatures in Tanga which has 45 degrees of latitude um but the latitude there is much higher and then smallbird like when I was there in September the temperature was like between minus5 and plus5 so like actually you know New Yorkers can totally adapts to it minus five and plus five I guess that's adapt at least it's it's it's not like too bad right I mean it does get it definitely does get bad in uh J like in January for example right but uh so you know there is a reason it has it grown to more than 3,000 people but it's like it's less bad than a lot of people think right and there is a town of 3,000 people and that town has a large supermarket and has a post office it has a hospital it has an airport and it has one of the best sushi restaurants I've been to in a while okay now it's going to have lots and lots of people going and visiting there we going to have 100,000 people right I mean like I think marginally it'll benefit from getting more people coming there right but it's uh definitely you know encourage people to just like go and visit and you know if they can visit for a longer time like you know given up to two weeks or so just to get a feel for like you know what it feels like to actually live in this kind of place um but it's interesting how even in a town of 3,000 people like that kind of infrastructure you can get right like you have a supermarket you have a hospital you have sushi um if you do the math then 3,000 people basically means that you have about 30 people per year level which means that so long yearb also has a school right and at 30 people that's enough for like one or two classes per grade uh so it's a actually surprising like how few people need to get at Le enough Network effects to at least have the to at least have the boring Basics right but the one thing that you can't get with 3,000 people is you can't get like people that are or around particular interests right whether that's for like work or whether that's for you know just like social interaction reasons right I've often thought about how the early American colonies it's only about two and a half million people at the time of Independence something like that you know the Greeks very small population at the time I think Rome was only like a million people yeah or something like I mean these are much smaller than we think of uh not not Rome the entire Empire but I think the city of Rome in the Roman Empire was like a million people at that time MH I might be wrong about that we'll check that in the show notes yeah the thing that's fascinating right is that 3,000 people is like actually yeah it's totally viable from that standpoint like I think as a resident at 3,000% down your main risk is getting bored right and also you have a risk of um you know not having not being able to find a good job and one way to answer that is to basically say we're only going to cater to remote workers and remote work is only going to grow from here another way to answer that is basically through the same channel that um we can answer the being board problem which is well let's look at the one type of town that already exists that has a small population that is still very interesting for people to often spend large amounts of time in and that's the University Town right so you know you have something like itha in Upstate New York population 30,000 home of Cornell and uh you know if you uh care about any of the academic topics that Cornell specializes in then like you know you're you're not going to be bored right and so if you like really concentrate and you really try to create a network effect around specific kinds of people then you don't you don't even need 30,000 like even 3,000 is going to be enough right like if half of those 3,000 are people who are into let's say crypto or let's say longevity research you can create an environment that's like gives people enough of that that it with a surprisingly small small size right um so then you know what do you get for that right one of the things that you get is uh I think cost savings right another thing that you get is uh like the right type of network effect right so you or a different type of network effect you sacrifice on quality and or you sacrifice on quantity and you get quality um cost savings are huge right like one of the big things that I think has happened over the last 10 years is that prices have increased in the US significantly more than they have increased in a lot of other countri we were talking about this I mean do you have a graph of that I'd love to I I think that's true but I'd love to see that I I I agree but go ahead you know I that's actually something that I haven't checked yet right like it just like it feels true from my from my personal experience in even Switzerland I think the price of like tea and Starbucks has increased very little or like maybe even not at all over the over the last 10 years which I thought was fascinating right so costs are huge and uh the cost difference between being in the US and being in basically any other country is like getting to be pretty significant at this point well I think to be fair it's always been significant but I think what we're seeing now is like it's qualita difference at the same time and you can earn outside right but it's like at the same time right a signific right one thing is that a significant cost difference of staying and other thing is that now you can earn outside and more generally like the quality of life difference between being in a major Center and uh and being in you know what gets called a kind of quote periphery location the cost of increase as the benefits of decreased and so they're coming closer together yeah go ahead exactly right so that creates a big opportunity right so cost is one um and then you know we've mentioned law is another one and uh law is an interesting one because um I think it's a it's one that a lot of people don't think about it and it's easier to not think about if you're in a situation that that is like that feels to you as being normal right because if you're just an average American and you know you're you're doing some completely you know Norby industry that's you're not pro going to feel you know law as like as being a large drag and and it's and it's even easier for you to get into the mindset of believing that oh if someone does come up to them and tell them the law is a big Dr well possibly they're doing something wrong and they have something to hide right and what's uh interesting is like the further away you get from like that kind of like privileged rich country context the and like I think it's even important to kind of you know talk about the rich country part right because like even the privilege discourse that exist within rich countries it tends to like at least in my view it focus a lot on underprivileged peoplein those rich countries but you know there's also this entire M like much larger mass of people around the around the world that are not even in those rich countries right and I think even the US and even progressives in the US often still have you know what's de facto very much and out out of sight out of mind mentality toward a lot of those people um but uh the further away you get from um you know being in in a uh a citizen of a rich country the further away you get from being in a kind of average industry the more you start feeling these kinds of things right so obviously the crypto space I think has uh felt regulatory pressures very keenly from the uh from the beginning but in 2022 I think caring about the law like really universalized in a lot of ways right in the sense that like there are a lot of countries like a non- us countries and even you know anti-western countries that have historically been authoritarian but the polit geopolitical environment for the last 20 years has been this kind of Fairly stable one and fairly friendly one where even in the authoritarian ones the authoritarianism kind of felt theoretical and it's like oh you know if you personally aren't somebody who like really cares about criticizing the government and like why would you even do that when I'll just focus on your family um then you're not really feeling much right you know you know focus on the family you know enjoy the enjoy the local culture enjoy the trains and it it doesn't look that bad in the normal case from like that kind of Co a cultural standpoint but like in 2022 in a whole bunch of ways the authoritarianism became real right and it became something that even really heavily touched the lives of normal people and it's something that just overnight created a whole bunch of like basically homeless Nomads right like I personally have multiple friends who in 2022 just like packed up left their country and they're just jumping around so they're not really clear where they live um and these in a lot of those cases these are even people who were not that worried about the political environments of where they came from before 2022 hit right so on the one hand you have a visual analogy that you may or may not agree with this is like a you know for example when you're driving on the highway your speed limit could be minimum 40 miles maximum 55 miles per hour and that's like a you know it's a bounding box that you have to be within your V has to be within that right and you start extending that to every other set of laws and essentially regulations in the law are a bounding box where you have to remain within that right speed greater than this you know not less than this you're you know B bank account balance uh at a certain time can't be over this or under this or me that's one um I don't know for example building cannot be more than this High it probably cannot be more than this low that kind of stuff right multiply that across thousands hundreds of thousands of laws all the laws so you have to sit within this box and most of the time most of your environment most of your life is configured to live within that box so you're so in the box that you don't even feel the edges but then sometimes like in 2022 or really recently those edges suddenly like move and they kind of put you outside of that box where what was totally normal suddenly becomes abnormal and you're you know looking around you're like how did that happen I thought I was just totally in the mainstream and then this just sliding of walls got you outside the mainstream and I think that in many ways what we're we do in crypto is for the power lless and the power user in different ways they're pushing the limits like the power list wants to hold down to a bank account and the power user is pushing the limits of what bank account can even do and sometimes they're the same person or the same entity like like binance is both absolutely a power user of money but I'm sure early on maybe now but you know they had like it's let's call it regulatory issues or what have you right like they you know well well reported um I you know I have no beef with binance whatsoever just saying sometimes it's the same person at the same time those are not necessarily disjoint categories and so that reminds me of what you're saying which is um these walls on this box that people took for being static became Dynamic these constants became variables right like some like I think up until 200 and 22 you just like had to be either one of those people whose situation was that you were in a beside a wall or in a or in a corner of the room or you just had to be an explorer that would frequently touch against them but like in 2022 the walls moved yes and exactly so so bringing that back to the start of new country thing right so if you could start a new country how would you so you know we talked about the climate aspect so we talked about cost so and now we're talking about law so it seems like what you try to do is hyper deflate cost or you know obviously I know I'm poking on this thing because I've thought about this a lot and you know um but you know what is e would you would it be ethereum based I assume either landia right um is there is there some funny uh etheria I don't know what would be the what would be the land if the dollar is a currency well it doesn't actually conjugate in quite that way right you might have Germany and the Germans but the mark doesn't quite conjugate so let's say you've got ethereum what does the ethereum land look like right and and is that related to this go yeah I mean it's a well right it's a good question I mean I think one of the questions is like what actually makes sense to create as a UA and then the other question is what level of TI should have to ethereum right because uh like on the second question like one of the things that I do want to be careful about is like not assuming um you know more agreement between people than actually exists and uh you know not basically like I I want to avoid getting into the like intersectional activism trap where you know you start by creating a community around one cause and then you know you start kind of like adding on more and more of these Coalition partners that have their own causes that you know they're they're good at expressing in your language but then a lot of the time when you poke into the details you're just end up getting stuck in a mindset where like the the you know the intersection of all the causes actually only be% people who are against what you're against but they're not for what you're for that's a tricky part where you'll win the war but you won't win the peace go ahead right that's exactly right so yeah to what extent like some uh you know new city or new country started by ethereum people like should Market itself as being a part of the ethereum verse or even being a central part of the ethereum verse right like those two are different like like to what extent uh like I think it would be it might even be good to be careful about creating the impression that if you're an ethereum person you have to like this other thing like I think it's it's big enough now it's millions of people using it so exactly like I think there's even um you know virtue in kind of you know people who are in uh multiple movements like basically yeah say like saying that it's okay to be with me on one thing but not but not the other thing on the second question right I think the the answer is maybe and I but at the same time I like I do think that there's huge moment momentum within the ethereum ecosystem for um wanting this kind of thing and so I think like the crypto world and the and the ethereum world are definitely like natural places start and I think are just inevitably going to be big parts of you know any new country that's or or any new city that gets created right um so it's it's you know there's about 300 million depending on how you count it but like coinbase and binance alone are a good chunk of at least 300 million crypto users worldwide who hold at least some cryptocurrency and I kind of do think of them as an Inuit country because you know they they all need to kind of accept each other's coin right and so they have to have in a sense a bilateral relationship where it started kind of currency and network first so it is a good group of people early adopters somewhat risk tolerant that could Pioneer something like this even if they aren't all pure 100% ethereum or what have you they likely certainly know about it and hold some um so that's why I think it's not a bad analogy or at least it's a it's a it's a predicate for it it's not it's not the full thing right I mean I think one good analogy for this might be like so if you take like foraster for example right so this actually gets to another um topic that I think is important which is uh that one thing that I think Network States and social networks have in common is that especially look to just to be able to get them started it's not about the institutions it's not about the technology it's about the people right like if if you imagine five clones of forecaster where let's say one of them is run by Dan Romero um another of them is run by let's say a an American trans social justice activist a third is run by let's say an Indian person a uh fourth is uh run by let's say uh some Eastern European Ultra Nationalist and who by the way likes Bitcoin and thinks that Bitcoin is the only coin um and a fifth is uh run by like some 14-year-old um in uh in hung Joo that just you know happens to be interested in in let's say like West African philosophy and has some you know really crazy A Fusion ideology that for whatever reason they can convince he can convince a significant fraction of Chinese people to or Chinese Generation Z or generation a to adopt by no one else right like those five forecasters are going to look very different I have I have a concrete a concrete example for you do you know what share chat is it is that third example it's an Indian social network that is non-english and so there's a Hindi Channel a Bengali Channel mum Channel Canada Channel and so on right thumel Channel and um so that's an example of something which is Twitter like but looks very different than actually because forecaster has ethereum functionality built into it so therefore it's like e Twitter this has it's it's just partition of different axis you wouldn't have thought of okay which Indian language do you speak as being a primary axis for foraster but it is for this right whereas foraster is like which nfts do you hold so it's just like moving on a different axis go ahead yeah right but I think the the larger point right is that like the the root Community is important and uh I think this was a lesson that I uh I think I kind of inted for ethereum itself right that uh like the one of the differences is between like web 2 and web 3 I think is that like things like Facebook they just Tred to scale to the world and reach out to everyone right and things in the crypto space and things in the network State space and things in even let's say the radical democracies based like they're they are more rooted in specific communities and they do they are I think kind of more respectful of the idea that like well sometimes Network effects aren't positive Network effects are negative right there are people who are negative value to other participants especially when you create like products or ecosystems where the interaction between the participants as I think it is it's like saying like law is meant for virtuous people and you know like I'm paraphrasing but that like the early the you know founding fathers said you know we can write all this stuff down but it's meant to deal with things in the breach you have to basically be good you know or like you have to be virtuous so it's kind of like that you the the structure is something that expresses the community's will okay so basically we've got about you know 15ish 10 minutes left um and uh so just to recap what did we talk about well we talked about a brief history of ethereum from concept to the present day we covered the merge and the Dow hack and ofac and privacy and a bunch of other things we talked about um you know what new country you'd start and addressing problems like climate and cost and whether ethereum people would be you talked about actually the really interesting place Spar that anybody can go to and how what open borders would actually look like in real life we have we have an empirical example of it should be on the cover of a bunch of books maybe it'll it'll be changed by that attention and I wanted to maybe touch on one last thing which is um you know we've talked about how to improve the world we've talked about how to improve ethereum how can people improve themselves what should they read watch and listen what online courses what should they be doing doing you know like how what would you advise people to do to to level up sure um so I think one of the reasons why this is an interesting topic is that it's not even entirely separate from the uh Network State topic right because uh to a very surprising extent I think like learning and motivation are very social right and they like being really successful in those things actually depends on having the right social environment and I think this is one of the key reasons why like for example um you know corser and the various muks have failed to completely replace Stanford to the uh in anything like the extent that a lot of people were predicting like I mean one aspect is definitely just like credentialism and the fact that the books don't give you fancy diploma but I think the like the social elements to learning and motivation is the other really big one and actually like the question of like what new country would I start like that might even be part of the answer right like I like I personally would start with a city before a country by the way I mean I would like a city loc a city located in a country that has enough of the right um you know law properties to get the 80 the 8020 of that right but like like trying to like actually you know tweak the root of uh you know of the legal system and like go at The Sovereign level like that's both it's very difficult and it's a very challenging project and there just like all kinds of international diplomatic risks that you don't really want to get into unless you're fairly big right and so I think you know working with existing countries is just something that's going to realistically make sense for projects going I think going into the future for a while right but starting on your city in but and at the same time like having the country aspect to the extent that you're creating a network effect in a country that that would otherwise not have that Network effect um but one of the things that I would add in there is uh definitely like have a stronger emphasis on like education as a part of the culture right like imagine going through your entire like your living experience for your entire life being a University at 10 at 10% intensity right so not a University at 100% intensity but you know keep it at 10% 10% intensity have like very um easy and like very socially available opportunities to constantly keep learning new things have funny say because basically sorry I didn't mean to cut you off but like the uh it's like buying a car a college education is like buying a car and not budgeting for maintenance over your life the entire cost is upfront and then you have no gas or oil change and then people are like oh I studied and like studied for four years and doesn't remember any of it this extremely expensive install of ostensibly education that is has zero maintenance associated with it you know no anyway go ahead so I'm agreeing with you learning I think um especially in the fast changing world that we're in like it really is something that should be a lifelong process right it's uh like and especially once we you know solve longevity I think I foret either Aubrey degre or someone else talked about this that like historically the pattern has been um study work retire but the Yu pattern might be study work retire study work retire study work study retire work retire study work study um and but the other approach of course is to like really integrate the two more and that like studying should not even necessarily be a phase it should just be a a regular part of your life right but so the social aspect is important right and I think like one of my number one advice is to like probably young people and old people everywhere is to be intentional about the social environment and um you know to have to have friends that help you bring out the virtues that you want to see in yourself um is uh something that I like I just think that's so hugely uh important right like you're there's just all kinds of subconscious ways in which your behavior changes for the better when you're around people that also because the way to prove that to people is just actually AI prompts like the prompt is so insanely important and so you're just getting effectively prompted in a sensory fashion by oh okay yeah all right they're lifting weights I should probably go and do that too like as a small example oh they're studying math oh yeah let me take a look look at that so like the prompts that you surround yourself with both digitally and physically have like such an influence on you and that and one of them is like your social network it's such an obvious thing but people don't usually think about it exactly yeah but I think you know until you can uh you know until we have multiple of these um established intentional communities and all this whether they're you know creating new cities or new or new countries or um you know new Bitcoin monasteries or you know whatever people in that or trying to create or whatever it's uh like things that you can do while you're by yourself um you I think like motivation as the number one problem is uh I think one of the key lessons that I've learned and uh there are like less not social ways to get that too right so like one of my personal experiences right is that like I've used dual lingual for a while I mean I've you know use that as one of my ways to kind of practice on my Spanish for a while have know also experimented with some of the other East Asian languages with it too and it's uh like the way that the app prods you into like just trying like uh into doing at least one thing every day and the way that the app makes you like even feel the fear of you know losing a multi hundred day streak um if you decide to go away from it like it's stupid and it's like so obviously you know gamified in a in a way that even seems a little bit trashy but like for me it works somehow like there are limits to it right so like one of the things that just to kind of go down the path of Theo in particular um that I found in that other people I found is that it pushes you to optimize not for the game of knowing the language but for the game of winning dualo right like for example sometimes dingo gives you a task like translate this sentence and like maybe about 20% of the time you don't even need to look at what's at the top of the screen like the yes sentence in Spanish or whatever you just like go down you look at the list of words that they give you to select from and there just obviously is one sentence in in English you can construct from those words and so you look at the bottom of the screen you just like tap that sentence and you're done right and like you've won the game but you haven't learn actually learned any Spanish yeah so I do think it's like importance to mix other tools I mean I could actually tell you the path that I took to learn uh Chinese um so so at the beginning I started with Pim that's p i Ms l e it's this set of online course or well um basically audio courses right so it's like a 30 minute like B course that for and they have 90 of them right you go through them and you know it gets you up to a very basic level right so I think different people might have different experiences but like for me personally you know there's this kind of on there's a stereotype that exists online that like it's possible to somehow pick up languages just by like you know going into a country and eventually kind of pick up words and uh obviously two-year-old kids can do it and possibly extroverts can do it but I totally can't right like if you just like stuck me into China with no training possibly even after 20 years I would not like you know quote pick up Chinese from zero I would just be miserable and uh but so for me personally you know for the first stage of learning language is like you know you need the structured stuff so I used psor um I also used some flashcard apps to learn the characters and then once you get P um above a certain point there's like a certain level of like medium comprehension where that's the point where you can start picking the language up from right so before medium um you know you start with the uh you know the podcasts um I did psor I think I did a Chinese pod and a couple of others um once uh you you know get past that point with the flashcard apps then you go like like for me personally you know and I actually spent like a total of about one and a half years in China and you know sometime in Taiwan and you know sometime in in Singapore and just like a lot of time talking to just like other Chinese friends that I had outside of China and uh it's once you get to that level then you actually can just like keep learning by by just talking to people right so talking to people um and this is ironically enough actually there's one particular way in which Chinese is easier than languages um like um you know German for example uh which is that uh if you try to speak in in English to or you try to speak in in broken German the someone in Germany very often they very quickly switch to English so you don't get those training wheels in China like this might part right exactly you don't get the training wheels right but like in Chinese know you know there's lots of people who barely speak English at all and like they're they'll be happy to try their their best to understand you um actually Spanish is um as well it's like I think in maybe in Spain a bit more English speakers but in like deep Latin America U you know definitely lots of people whose English is very bad and uh you could definitely get your Spanish up there especially if if you try right but like past the other thing that I did in China is like you just like walk around the city and you look at street signs and the street signs they all have the name of the street in Chinese characters and then the name of the street in pinion right that gives you the pronunciation and so you just like look at street names and you passively learn a whole bunch of characters just like as part of your life right so like basically yeah so to get from like zero to Mid um you know you do the podcasts so you do the flash card apps you do the like very structured courses and then to get from bid to high that's when like picking things up and and the more so social approach um that's that's a good combination so basically if you're an adult to summarize if you're an adult don't just start with immersion do courses to bootstrap yourself to that basic level get your bios up and running and then you can kind of assimilate content if you're two years old you might just be able to be dumped in right exactly yeah and then for technology um that for like things like cryptography for example um I one of my lessons has been the importance of learning by doing right like if you just um you know if you just read and listen there's just it's just so easy to kind of go you know in one ear or or one eye and out the other um but if you actually make yourself build a thing that's the way that like you actually kind of get the knowledge into muscle memory like you you work with the concepts with your brain in a much deeper way you ever heard of Shams outlines it's basically like I have very similar Shams outlands are pretty famous in India basically these yellow outline books where they just have solve problems they just go straight to solve problems and so you just go straight to the exercises and there like relatively minimal introduction you just go straight to the exercise just like just start working out not reading about working out you work out you know and that's similar to this where basically by coding coding it by building it and then trying to break it you understand it in a way that just Theory alone reading about it doesn't get you something no that's actually fascinating like if try try the the idea of teaching people even without content but but by by just like repeatedly giving them exercises that are like one inference step away from the previous exercise that they solved regardless of I you know what specific tool you use I think if you learn if you want to learn about snars build a snark if you want to learn about how ethereum Works build an ethereum implementation and get it to pass some of the tests or even get to the point where it passes all the tests and then um if you want to learn about like homeomorphic encryption build an implementation of homeomorphic coruption right like if you want to learn about AI then like actually you know build a a neural network that's like you know at least powerful enough to do some like basic job of recognizing digits or whatever right that's uh I think that's one of the things that helped me um in 2011 I went through some the machine learning course on I forget the the there was one in Udacity and one in corsera that was one by one was by Andrew right one was by run one was by Andrew in and they were very Hands-On right where like you had to actually Implement you know a lot of like things like AAR um search search algorithms and like impl you know multi-layer neural networks and all of those things so actually implementing a thing and just like gives you this very deep and and Hands-On understanding about like what the thing is and uh you know how to work with it it just gets intuitions that you can't get by just reading a textbook and so highly uh you know encourage taking an experiential approach um you know definitely it's uh the you know I think there it's the equivalent of like the the Star Wars like a tra kind of Jedi tradition where you're supposed to build your own lightsaber right it's do or do not there's no try except for the merel Patricia try which by the way you should actually do an Implement that's a good one that's a but so lesson you know build your own um people um laws and um and the land um you know sacrifice quantity of network facts go for Quality um you know get the get the right group of people um you know be modest on on law espe especially at first um you know Prov focus on the public goods motivation um if you want to learn about things then um you know go and build your own lightsaber and I think awesome yeah lots of stuff for people to do thanks for coming on talic and this is is the first episode of the network State

and and deining and that sort of stuff I like I I definitely recognize that there's you know like some level of uh you know like disconnect there I mean my uh my ideal of course right is to like turn the disconnect into an alliance right like I don't think I can uh I don't think I'll ever be able to like credibly pretend you know to be one of the dents but at the same time if you know you can create a structure where like people can have their fun and uh at the same time like actually like contribute to funding public goods at a nation state level um and uh like actually create what probably the only structure that's like independent from existing nation states that support things at that scale like that feels like a massive win-win outome right and like to me creating that win-win outcome in a way that where both sides like feel genuinely happy about it like that's the ideal [Music] [Music] welcome Lads we are very very excited uh vitalic is here he's here with us this is not an AI vitalic this is the real one um that means that you know ethereum has officially bottomed this is this I'm hard calling it I will I will uh I will back that up with my reputation at this point uh welcome vitalic yeah thank you guys happy to be here as I was like you know trying to schedule uh this podcast um I asked you for I guess like your email for like a Google calendar invite and I was told that you don't actually do calendar but it's you just take everything or you just like schedule everything your pen and pen and paper so like how do you how do you do that like how how how do you so organized yeah I I have I have a text file uh so I L literally a txd that's sitting in the home directory on my laptop and I know it said know December 11th 0700 podcast with ta and so here we are appreciate it thank you thank you I love it I picture there like the bell curve meme on the left and the right it's just like just use a notepad and then in the middle you have like Google Calendar optimizing with all these different scheduling tools yeah yeah I'm like actually very trash nice I want to jump right into the meat of the show so August 21st this viral tweet you posted uh the that was AI generated saying that ethereum is good um you know you mentioned you told you you were told you need to do less philosophizing more ethereum bull posting and here it is uh but in the spirit of the new meta which is going around today the AI meta on Sola and Bas like what are your thoughts there what are your thoughts on the AI agents is it something exciting is it what you expected to happen in our space this year yeah and so I did write a post on crypto AI intersections at the start of the year right and uh I basically talked about like four categories right where it's uh one was crypto defining the game and AI playing the game and then a so AI as a player in the game AI as the interface to the game AI as the rules of the game and AI as the objective of the game and I think uh my one of the things that I said is definitely that AI as a player in the game is the easier thing to do and it feels like that's probably the category that we've been seeing most of the stuff in so far um and then also I think we've been seeing a lot of things where the goal isn't really to like create an application the goal is that you're basically just you know sitting in that AI out there and then the AI is like doing things and having fun and people are having fun with it uh so it's uh I guess like some some mix of expected and unexpected yeah yeah just just for um maybe not everyone's read the blog it's been a while I guess since I read it um when you say being the player in the game can you can you kind of differentiate what it would look like if it was one versus the other the example that I gave that kind of illustrates the category right is that we've actually had AI crypto intersections for like literally a decade and it's called automated markting Market making Bots playing in decentralized exchanges and it's a kind of a trivial example but it's also a meaningful example because you can take that General concept and you can stretch it very far right so the second example that I had in mind was AI playing in prediction markets and we see know there's the experiments that the omen team is doing there's uh a couple of other things that are similar to that then the uh another interesting example this is actually an experiment that is going to be I think like properly announced in a couple of days which is so I guess by the time people hear about hear this might already be announced which is public goods funding right basically the idea is that you have this small group of human judges that basically decide on like very narrow questions that basically yeah if it's like is Project a a or Project B more responsible for the success of like some particular project C right and the the idea is like you create this big graph and you try to answer the question like how much funding do different public goods projects deserve and the problem is that if you try to make human judges answer big Grant questions like how important is this particular software library for the the welfare of collective Humanity this is like what of these you know like Grand kind of semi-religious far mode questions that's basically impossible for human beings to answer right like there's a a famous uh study where you someone wents around and asks people how much money would you be willing to pay to save 2,000 birds or 20,000 birds or 200,000 Birds and the answer was on average $80 in all three cases right and so the idea is basically that you try to create instead we create this like graph where you have you know like different dependencies so we say you like what percentage of uh you know like the total value in ethereum could be attributed to say go ethereum as opposed to say like a web 3GS library or as opposed to like say subop Source wallet and then within that you say well what percentage of go ethereum but um know corresponds to this library and so like you break question down into sub questions and human judges like basically spot check in a few randomly so places but then it's up to AI submitters to just like fill in like millions of weights for the whole graph right and the the analogy that I use is it's like human judges are the steering wheel and AI is the engine and one of my goals here is that it basically becomes this kind of fun game where it's basically a programming competition right like you know when I was 60 and I was doing these programming competitions like one of the things that you would do is there would be like a game and uh when I did it it was this kind of battle game where you control some number of uh Bots and they like fight off against know the bots of the other team and you have to like run the code that these Bots run on here the competition is like people are supposed to make AIS that basically figure out all these allocations for like what percent of the credit for X goes to Y um and then humans like spot check at a few different places and dais that pass a spot check the best are the ones that win and like the stuff that I had in mind there stuff that's uh in that category yeah I'm curious like have you I guess a lot of our audiences probably wondering like are you in the trenches have you do you sort of play around with every new onchain meta that comes around and every new onchain app do you have time to experiment on chain and play around or are you more taking a high level view at this point um again so I think I definitely go deep on a few specific things right so like I yeah you know I'm obviously a big poly Market ball and uh I have this big poly Market portfolio and uh I mean I definitely know not sure if I should share it publicly because it involves like multi hundred, thousand bets on mean like crazy political topics but it's like what one of them is you know will there be a civil war in the UK and I'm like no the chance of that is not 4% uh but so that's one that I've gone ve very deep on were you the friend whale betting on Trump I regrettably am not French um I that's pav durov you know different Russian I uh I mean I gu I guess I'm a whale I I have not actually been on Trump my My Philosophy is basically like if there's something that has a lot of attention on it in a prediction market then like generally it's harder to get an edge and like you want to find the things where you do like relatively still have an edge I yeah I mean I did bet that Trump would lose the election after he already lost the election in 2020 so I earned about $558,000 off of that uh so that so that PO Market was one where I you know like went really deep do you feel do do you feel like a head of state like you know after Trump wins even the the European presidents of France and Italy they might not love Trump but like they're like okay this guy's in charge now like as a head of state and and you let's say like as a as a head of a digital state in essence you know you have to to be politically good with you know whoever is the current powers that be do do you feel that way at all yeah that's a it's an interesting question I mean I think like my goal for ethereum is that I think ethereum should not have like one representative I think it should uh know like half bet representatives and I think to the extent that we have a role I feel like the way that I conceive of my role is like or and even the ethereum foundation's role is that you know we have a perspective and that perspective is a pro crypto perspective in the sense that we don't want the stuff to be banned but it's also not the same as you know the perspective of like VCS and exchanges for example right and if you take like if you take like one specific issue for example like privacy right like I uh support privacy quite a bit um and you know I've donated to the mil Robin storm legal defense recently and then I also o mil like worked quite a bit on privacy pools which is this like privacy solution that tries to like exclude like large scale defi hackers and like basically try to address some of the Regulators concerns and like privacy is something that you know anti- crypto people would uh like their vision of privacy is basically yeah you know we're going to you label the word privacy to we're going to redefine the word privacy to mean you can be in a position that feels private but actually you know our Security National Security people all have back doors and then if um you know a certain opposing nation state hacks us then they also have a back door but you know we're g to like that's the Privacy you get and then you know they use this totally different scary word like secrecy to refer to actual privacy and uh on the other hand if you're like a a uh an ex exchange or like moneymaking actor then like you're not anti-privacy but there's also not a large incentive to push for it and so I yeah like that's one of those things that I like really actually try to push um so I think like there's but then when you engage with all of these political things like it's important to be careful right and like I you know definitely have my own um experience where I went into Russia back in you know 2018 and you know met with Vladimir Putin and there were a lot of people who said very nice and sweet things like oh you know our in our country we wants to try to be more open and we wants to try to be less corrupt and vade could be a great way to do that and like come and like let's work together and then figure this out and of course if you actually look at the consequences of my actions I think I did not make Russia more open but I probably did contribute a little bit to making know Vladimir Putin look more legitimate as bombs started falling in marup right so like that's the thing that I don't want to repeat right and so the yeah yeah so it's yeah it's something that's worth being careful about yeah that I just I was thinking in like a a second thread like what other things I was uh in the trenches about on crypto um I mean other one that comes to mind is obviously just like token exchanges right so I get you know lots of these meme coins and you know I end up using them for like various charity purposes and you know like go around sometimes like you know cow swap Unis swap Paris swap the various swaps uh cross chain bridging and all of those things so that's also another another one of those things that I've gone pretty deep on I mean but then there's definitely also like these other big sectors of uh a crypto that I've like largely missed and like I'm I'm definitely willing to acknowledge that yeah so speaking of I guess like meme coins and speculation um obviously like that's been one of the biggest narratives uh and I guess like The Meta is the cycle um and referring to you know your 2017 tweet uh where I think the the total cryptocurrency market cap hit half a trillion um and then then you know have we earned it right and I think right now the current total Mark cap is 3.5 trillion so 7x that um and like my question to you is do you think we've earned it you know uh like seven years later what do you think we are it's it's weird right it's uh like I mean there's like a troll part of me that wants to like basically whack myself and say like come on the whole concept of earning it just lost the election uh so that's uh like like you know you do feel a bit of that like Twitter Vibe right like this idea that you know like that is even the frame with which you're supposed to think about stuff is uh sort of less uh invogue now than it was a few years ago and like I think there's uh like I think that's a pulum that is Bounce the swing back at some points right because uh you know you can't build a a you can't build a civilization on it um and uh like right and like like generally I you know I do think that the the larger crypto space and especially the kinds of uh people that like especially a lot of the energy that we've seen in like the last one to one and a half years like there's definitely a sense in which people have kind of given up on even trying and like that worries me right can can you clarify what you mean by that do you mean trying to Value assets based on fundamentals or trying to add fundamental value to a token uh like what do you mean by that yeah I mean what I mean what I mean by that is like I think we've uh like there was a lot of you know idealistic energy in the crypto space back in uh 2017 to 2020 and like basically thinking about this as like building new and better institutions and uh you know creating credibly neutral BL fors and supporting Priss finance and uh like actually like building things that are meant to last that people could get behind like the kind of mentality that know created bitcoin in the first place right it does feel like there's less of that now right and it it does feel like the game is basic like there's a part of this space where the game is like oh you know that like it doesn't matter and let's have some fun and like I'm definitely yeah you know not anti-un by any means but know like like fun can't be the only thing right and like to me I think the healthy thing is always when you have fun and some other objective that are kind of playing nicely together with each other right because uh other like if if those two sides are disjoints then like that basically creates a big problem right it's a you know you want like you want fun you want personal financial onen I mean you're You're such like a you know right curve deeply thought guy what how much do you feel like you understand the the um the fun side or I remember like you know famously last cycle you got like you said to your wallet somebody sent I think it was like half the shiba inu Supply or just some some super high amount of uh Shiba Inu and then like suddenly you know you check your wallet and you're like what is this I have some erc20 token billions of dollars like what do you understand it like do you just accept it as one of these you know oh humans you know humans are playing and I don't know what's going like how much how much what what were you thinking when you saw that yeah I mean what I was what I was thinking practically speaking was like look okay you know there's this sha enu thing and like practically speaking there is a huge amount of good that you can do with a few hundred million dollars right and like basically yeah I was assuming that hey this thing went up in a week and therefore it's going to go down in a week and like I have to just scramble to get those coins out and like get something out of them and like we actually ended up doing that right like we actually ended up funding a lot of just really fascinating biotech right and that you know a lot of like anti- airborne disease stuff a lot of longevity stuff I like upgrading medical infrastructure in India like the budgets that came out of that like those animal coins were like literally comparable to the budget of the World Health Organization right and like it's like same order of magnitude like like the crazy fact you just stated of like wow this budget is is this big like is this something that do you reflect upon it and you're like wow it like why are people speculating to the extent where we're creating you know a national budget here um or do you just accept it as like okay people just gamble and and then let's do some good I think at the time I basically just accepted it as like hey people just gamble and uh let's uh let's do some good I think uh I mean yeah like the style of just throwing large amounts of uh you know like money into a into a gambling thing is definitely something that's like not at all Native to by psychology right and yeah like in in you know in general like like I've definitely done fa quite little of like you know playing or playing around with tokens and like buying and selling and and and Ding and that sort of stuff uh so that's uh like I like I I definitely recognize that there's know like some level of know like disconnect there um I think I mean my my ideal of course right is to like turn the disconnect into an alliance right like I don't think I can I don't think I'll ever be able to like credibly pretend you know to be one of the dents but at the same time if you know you can create a structure where like people can uh have their fun and uh at the same time like actually yeah like contribute to funding public goods at a nation state level um and like actually create what probably the only structure that's like independent from existing nation states that support things at that scale like that feels like a massive win-win outcome right and like to me creating that win-win outcome in a way that both where both sides like feel genuinely happy about it like that's the idea I wanted to ask you vitalic about something that's I would say one of the main conversations I'm seeing on crypto Twitter and very popular to talk about and very contested in the ethereum community and that is this topic of ethereum's North Star I guess there's two questions here like does ethereum lack a North star and if not what is the North Star this post sort of lays out you know like Bitcoin we accept is this digital gold it's secure they don't do much but they do one thing really well Solana is decentralized NASDAQ or as Jordy put it maybe it's more like decentralized maau like where does ethereum fit here you know Solana is faster and more performant but decentralized but you have Bitcoin on the other side of the spectrum for your security and decentralization it's like where is ethereum in all of this yeah I mean so I think if you like think about it in the frame of those categories the really important Insight is that like those categories actually will make the most sense when they're together right and the reason why is basically that if you have Bitcoin as digital gold but then you separately have this other layer that does the financial stuff then if you wants to use your Bitcoin on that other layer then you need to have trust right like you needs to basically have some kind of bridging mechanism and because the bridging mechanism is not native it has to be backed by some kind of individual some kind of multisig and there is people who are fine with that but then in practice you know we saw is like you know there's like the bit I think bitco go like wbtc multisig that people trusted for a long time and then I think it ended up like recently being bought by Justin sun or like something like that right and uh basic the the problem is that if you try to you know separate the gold from the functionality then you just have this like really big gaping trust hole and you know you you end up having this constant risk of basically ongoing Mount gax and FDX type situations right so and like this is something that I've been like basically consistently saying for like almost the last 10 years right I uh I have a post from like I think 2018 where I said something like I think it was called like f base wers and the functionality escape velocity where I basically argued that like the optimal thing for a blockchain is to like be Bitcoin plus a little bit more and the little bit more is just enough so that you actually can have these uh trustless connections to other things right and I basically argue that the little bit more is like one a little bit more scripting so that you get you know what what I call Rich statefulness what some people in incorrectly call being to incomplete into you need data availability to support lawyer twos right and so it's like Bitcoin plus a little bit more so that you can actually use the Bitcoin to do interesting stuff without sticking all of these you know like extra trusted intermediaries in there right is basically you what uh I've always thought of like ethereum as going for um I think uh if I had to just like step out of that frame and answer the question holistically right so you know I think of ethereum as being the world computer and I think of L1 as being the trust uh anchor and L2 as being the GBU right and L2 is uniquely able to be powerful precisely because it's sitting on top of the L1 right like if you're on an if you on a highly performance L1 and that L1 takes centralization tradeoffs like if it breaks your SC right but if you're on a highly centralized L2 then no matter what happens to the L2 you can take your coins out you can with draw them and you can actually get them back on the L1 just just to like try to uh make sure that we understand correctly and and I understand it uh what you're saying is um you know Bitcoin came has all these great properties but uh if you want to actually use your Bitcoin have it programmable do more defi stuff as we know it's not sort of like designed for that and what you wanted to do with ethereum and kind of like the the North Star in essence is um let's get that part but also add enough programmability where it is able to you can trustless move it around without Bridges and you have enough confute to actually be able to um to have you know billions of users which you know Bitcoin as designed cannot um and being that the case is does it mean that um the way that you know ethereum wins this category of programmable money is it by um being better technology than the other layer ones because uh once you go down that slippery slope isn't it sort of like well the next the next guy can also say I'm Bitcoin Plus+ and I'm Bitcoin Plus+ plus now like H how do we frame that yeah so this is why like I use escape velocity as an analogy right so you know from Earth you know escape velocity is 11 km to together of Earth orbit 17 Kil 11 kilm a second to get out of Earth orbit 17 kilm a second to get out of the solar system right and then once you've go past the 17 kilometers a second then like you can basically go anywhere right and uh right well actually to get out of the solar system I guess you would have to combine really 11 and the 17 to jump out of both both gravity Wells right but then once you're past that hump like you can go anywhere right and like it's a category difference right like once you get past to the category barrier then like you can be more efficient but like really you've gotten past the hump where you can do it at all and like that's really you like actually the the the thing that matters um and so Bas the thing that I argue is that ethereum is aiming for the minimal like um level of extra functionality so that you can do what you need to do um and then if you want to like do more and if you want to do things that are more performant then you know the L2 ecosystem does exist right and so it's basically saying know you can use the L1 directly and like I definitely believe in some level of upgrading the L1 right so like there's discussions happening on incre slowly increasing the gas limit there's discussions that are happening on uh making the uh U Know evm uh more powerful in certain ways and like I even think that there's definitely some applications that belong on the L1 right um like I think one simple exam reason why right is like if you think of certain kinds of high value defi like if you have a liquidation happening then like a liquidation happening at the same time as some crazy yeah know like L2 shutting down that requires everyone to do you know like some kind of like massive restol thing like that's more dangerous than just it being on an1 right uh so I like I believe some things should happen on an1 but in general I feel like the the froner of performance is uh the is the l2's job to pursue and like I definitely think that e theum should not fall into the Trap of like being a tech company right because like tech companies they get like rotated every 20 years right so you know like you talk about uh like we can talk about the idea of like being a decentralized NASDAQ but then the reality is like the market cap of uh you know like regular NASDAQ and nyc's and all these are like in the low tens of of billions of dollars right and so if you want to make something Timeless then you can't be directly playing the front your technology game what you need to be doing is playing the game of uh being an environment that's welcoming and attractive for other people to join you and to keep playing the frontier technology game along with you right and like that's something that Bitcoin also has tried to do right and you know like obviously it's had the lightning network but then like Bitcoin basically has a hard time and my argument why is that like it it just it hasn't quite reached escape velocity right and so like that's the balet he wants to get to escape velocity but he don't wants to like actually play the game of like accelerating to light speed as a base player fatal I want to ask you like on this note of decentralized NASDAQ Solana obviously they've done a great job at building community growing competing with ethereum I'm curious like what do you think we as the ethereum community can learn from Solana and then also on that note if you were starting an L1 today from scratch what how would it look differently than how ethereum looks today what would you do differently yeah I mean I think okay so one like big mistake that I think ethereum did actually make probably back in the 2020 era is we were definitely like late on the switch from like valuing research and ideas to valuing software execution and I think Solano is pretty early on the game to like actually valuing know like getting that last bit of optimization out of software and I mean that's the game where like even Solana's predecessors like like things like EOS were really doing before as well right um and know that side of things is important and that's definitely not something that like if culture Circa 2020 emphasized at all and I think that was a mistake I think these days that's a a mistake that's been like largely corrected for right and you see you know Paradigm and rest you see nethermind uh you know you see this collection of teams that's uh really started to focus on like value that high performance side of things so it does exist in the ethereum ecosystem now right but you know at the same time there is a leg um if I was starting ethereum now I think I don't think there's like one big answer right I think there's like a lot of uh a lot of little answers uh so like if you think of the ethereum if you just look at the ethereum spec like it's definitely maybe three or four times more complicated than it needs to be right and there's these other projects I me like things like Mina um like projects that are basically trying to make like ZK friendly minimal simple beautiful um LS from scratch and uh I think and and you know Justin has the beam chain proposal and I think the beam chain proposal basically is like a way to try to replace ethereum with that on like a fiveyear time scale right but there I mean I know like he got whacked by the internet for you know the 2029 number a lot right and I think they're like the argument like I think what we're actually trying to do right is like in the next one to two years we want to focus on delivering features that users really need just on the you know you you mentioned um Justin Justin presenting this like super long uh 2029 and I guess like you're right like for our audience I'm sure this was something that we all saw the the reaction we all had like similar reaction of um is ethereum kind of of the European Union W which you know we love Europe I'm European you know I'm sure you love Europe as well it's a great place um it's been around a long time but in the sense of you know maybe this is where it all started but the European Union at this point does it does it have similar um issues as like the ethereum foundation let's say and and this ethereum progress where let's say salana is the US you just very capitalist just you know okay let's take shortcuts let's get the performance um activity happens and we'll fix it later you know we we'll we'll decentralize more later we'll fix it um do do you feel like the criticism is valid in the sense of everything is happening now the world is forming um there are path dependencies on scale and escape velocity and these things that you mentioned and uh having a mindset of like too much philosophy not enough urgency to improve things now and and really kind of listen to feedback and respond to feedback um is that is that something that maybe is valid to reflect on or how do you think about it yeah and so I think among people who think about politics it's a pretty standard opinion that the goal of democracy is not to be great the goal of democracy is to not be Hitler right uh so you know I'm uh basically yeah democracy is this kind of variance reducing machine and it does mean that you're not going to build a amazing skyscrapers that you see in Dubai but you know it does that you're not going to launch a crazy invasion of half the world right and the like to me know like that aspect of things is important because ultimately blockchains are about giving people conf confidence right if you don't care about giving people confidence then like eventually you can just get out competed by a server right and so that's like the good part of like that kind of approach now the idea behind capitalist to democracy at least went done well right is i' I've heard it described I forget by who maybe s boria maybe someone else as it's like capitalist democracy is a and like you know and especially sort of you know billionaires as an institution is like a way for democracies to have their own pet dictators so they can have the upsides of dictators without the downsides right and so the argument is like okay you know the US is not going to have a government that builds all of the fancy skyscrapers like Dubai but on the other hand it has Elon and like the best thing that Elon can do is take the US to Mars and uh the worst thing that Elon can do well he does not have the ability to put you in jail right and like the worst thing that he can do is fire you so you know this this is the argument right this is the theory and the the theory is like it's it's this kind of barbell approach right right where you have uh the political machine which is variance reducing and then you have the capitalist machine which is variance increasing and then the the job of the political machine is to basically let the capitalist machine sort of do run the uh the program but uh can strain it from um you know like basically the the 8020 like the 20% of the worst stuff that he can do that actually might do 80% of the damage and so the equivalent of this in ethereum right I think think historically our philosophy has been that the L1 L2 model is like all about trying to do that right so it's like in this analogy you know the l2s are the pet dictators right but they're still constrained by ethereum and but you know they're able to deliver scale they're able to deliver speed and I definitely think it's uh like worth re-evaluating like what aspects of that have succeeded and what aspects of that have failed right so the biggest critic I think there have been two criticisms probably maybe maybe like a few criticisms this year and I'll you know I could go in the list right so number one is obviously interoperability right and you know like optimism and arbitrum don't natively talk to each other and so now it's become a big movement within ethereum to try to improve interoperability and like make the cross2 world like feel like um a single ethereum ecosystem other one is on the security side right it's like from the ethereum perspective we don't want L2 is to just be trust me multi but the l2s it's like from the perspective of the team the team is totally fine trusting themselves and so the TM is like totally fine being a trust me multi right and you know we've obviously tried to like put some transparency into that by supporting L2 bead and uh I think the thing that we've actually started to see is that the thing that's really started to move the needle on that is basically we've been starting to see this Market separation between L2 teams and Technical teams right because like two years ago those were completely merged right but now like you see nether mind as a tech house that serves many l2s you see Paradigm as a tech house that serves many l2s optimism as a tech house that serves all of the L2 in the super chain and uh the benefit of this approach is basically that if you once you have this separation you have a much smaller number of like much more competent St houses that can then focus on like actually getting the proof system to be trust trustful enough that it's that you can have real l2s right so that and that's also something that I think is going to be really important improving on the interoperability side um so those are some of the problems another problem is like incentiv misalignment right which is basically that like l2s have separate tokens from eth um and like the sets of holders are kind of somewhat disjoint and then there's this whole argument of like maybe it would have been healthier if they just all got Ico instead of being BC launched um but realistically you know the al2s exist and now it's a matter of like figuring out how do we align that's a great point and I want to double click in on that and ask you more about that so I think correct me if I'm wrong but you publicly stated roughly like 90% of your net worth is in ethereum so like obviously it's very important that ether does well for you personally and of course you're passionate about it but I think a lot of the criticism around incentives has really been around you know with these l2s they're not necessarily bring all of that value back to ethereum as you sort of alluded to like with uni chain if all of Unis swap transactions go to UNI chain clearly the burn is going to be less relevant and before we have this clear narrative that like there was this burn it was basically like a share buyback we could clearly model out how much ethereum should be worth based on activity but now it feels to me as an outsider that ethereum has sort of shifted away from that and I'm curious like how you think about ethereum's value is changing and what it should actually be in the future yeah I mean so I think there's like a couple of connected questions right one of those questions is like where does the value of a cryptocurrency even come from and like honestly like I think we should acknowledge that a big part of the value of a cryptocurrency is like to little Voodoo right like you know you see amazing technical projects and almost all of them are worth much less than a cryptocurrency whose only value is a famous internet meme dog right it's like okay yeah you know you have a currency named after a dog and then one day it goes up 38% in one day and jumps from being like number nine to being number six or whatever just because Elon Musk is creating a US Government Department that's named after it right and uh it's I mean even generally right if you think about the uh you know the the discounted cash flow model of a a token like it just uh like that's obviously not how the uh largest of the uh large coins are being valued right like Bitcoin is M know much uh um worse on the DCF um metric than you know if ethers and yet right now it's still four times higher right and like the Bitcoin people themselves right they don't have a good answer to this right because uh you know in 2020 you remember they were very actively pushing the stock to flow model and if you look at the stock to flow charts since then basically it's like the chart did a very good job of tracking the price up until the point the model was published but then after the model was published like it almost became an anti-correlation right like if you go to stock to flow page right now like you basically see that the Bitcoin price has actually started incre increasing ining after the stock to flow predicted price stopped increasing like that's almost like literally what's happens right now right and so there's like a huge amount of this kind of uncertainty and so I think un there we go yes exactly right so it was the other way around right so you see how the Bitcoin price was going up while the stock to flow was a flatline and then as soon as the stock to flow stopped being a flat line Bitcoin itself became a flat line right I mean italic like in some sense it it it is voodoo in some sense because you know these are chaotic systems with you know thousands millions billions of people interacting and you know it's sort of like this AI thing where you have all these weights and you don't exactly know what's happening but uh when you break it down to the individual there's somebody making a decision to buy an asset whether it's Doge and their reasons might be uh Elon Musk is worth X he's obsessed with with this coin therefore you know it's sort of like a part percentage of his net worth in his mind and you can valuate that way who knows for Bitcoin I think a lot of the people buying are buying um for real reasons it's not like Voodoo reasons either they're um they're diversifying from gold uh they're like okay maybe like this is going to be the new one um maybe sort of like it it's uh oh well the institutions are coming therefore you know it's going to go higher let me participate in this um there are reasons why why the individual even if the collective is chaotic right yes yeah the micro makes perfect sense I think the analogy there is like the weather right it's yeah so the weather you know each individual like if you zoom out into if you zoom into individual atoms and molecules they follow incredibly yeah like basic understandable laws but then if you zoom out to like predicting if it's going to rain tomorrow even today we make mistakes right uh so I think on the question on a high level is like how can we be in a position of high uncertainty how can we be positioned in a way that is like maximally ensures that each continues to get value and like basically doesn't get sidelined and in a way that's like very robust to a lot of different theories about like what why individual people are buying tokens and where individual value is coming from and uh I think uh you one uh like very high level conclusion right is that there have to be forces of some kind on the application layer that like have an interest in putting East front and center right and right now like the challenge is like from an L2 perspective like with these l2s so far they've made e be the base token uh but you know is that the in their selfish interest I you know in the long term not necessarily I then applications I you know they could use e as a base token but like is there an actual like selfish interest tie in there right like it's like not by default um so one uh one of the recent ideas that I've seen come out in this base so the nether mind team recently announced surge right which is this effort to basically do make uh a collection of like neutral rollups right so l2s that uh basically have the ethereum brand and the ethereum brand only right and where there's no like separate like storge brand and surge token that's trying to get ahead uh kind of present itself in front of the user in some way and to me like that seems like a really worthwhile experiment um so it does it feels like maybe there's a possibility where like a portion of the L2 space and especially the portion of the L2 space that's basically just more conservative and they're trying to be bards of ethereum instead of being kind of accelerate all the way down to like one nanc latency or whatever like for it might make sense for that part of L2 space to just be something that exists under the ethereum umbrella and uh like maybe that like that's also something that's uh worth know like trying and and building an ecosystem around getting out applications so like that's uh you know one of those possible answers you know I think last cycle um I think Justin Dre came up and like list came out like the ultrasound money thesis so would you like how would you categorize or how would you you know describe e the asset like is eth money are you trying to create something that's competing with Bitcoin as a store Valley or like how would you I guess describe you know e the asset yeah I mean eth is definitely its own thing um I think I mean to like the the bankless you know thesis of a triple point asset is one that is like it's like one of those old memes that I think is worth breaking back right in the sense of you know it is a you know store value commodity asset similar to bitcoin but at the same time it has a a strengthened position because it also has access to these extra Tailwinds and uh you know Nev burn is a Tailwind d559 burn is a Tailwind being used as collateral in applications is a tailwind and for ethereum to prosper like basically either the the store value thesis on its own works out or any one of the Tailwinds needs to be strong enough to support it right so like that to me is the is the the value proposition behind ether the asset right and you know we've definitely had periods in history where any of those Tailwinds have been very successful yeah but T so I know like we've mentioned so many different ways to evalue ethereum but I feel like people in our space in some ways are like scared to admit that however we try to model these things we just don't know how to Value them like Anatolia said Solana is not money and it shouldn't be looked at like that most people in the ethereum community think it is money and should be looked at that like do you have a mental model on how to determine when eth is overvalued or undervalued like what are you looking at to determine that my honest answer is I uh don't right like I feel like I have a I have like high LEL a high level long-term view which is basically that like gold currently has like a 10 to 20 trillion dollar market cap but honestly like gold is kind of lame um gold has uh you know gold definitely requires trusted custodians to do things with gold is you know not permissionless in sense of sh resistant and I think to younger Generations you know the psychological idea of tangibility is like itself becoming more digital Than Physical right like being able to hold something with your private Keys is is like as TBS being able to hold it in your wallet and so I don't see any reason why like the the store of value premium that gold has can't just like really substantially migrate over to cryp to as an asset class over the next couple of decades especially as people who grew up in a much more Crypton native than gold native context are going to just continue becoming a larger and larger share of the economy uh so I think uh like so just from this like very very abstract looking at things from a mind share perspective like that's one of my simple cases to be financially bullish on crypto um so yeah compare gold to crypto also compare you know real estate speculation to crypto right real estate is also one of those historical safe havens that's also recently breaking for a lot of people and uh it definitely doesn't have the political safety use case that's becoming more important I think the easy part is to say that the total crypto market cap should be you know maybe in the tens of trillions because of like you said these analogies clearly like they're Superior attribut but within the the crypto coins you know Bitcoin ethereum salana Etc um I think what Justin was alluding is that there's very little uh common understanding of how relatively you we know we distribute the pi what makes sense you mentioned the triple point asset for for ethereum uh when I hear triple point asset if I look at any of those things individually for me they're all the same thing it's it's more of like um what's the what's the strength of the community because if there's things being burned means activ the community is active if people are holding it as like money it means you know the community is very strong and they're sending e to each other right yeah exactly I mean the the word I was going to say is mind share right like mind like mind share is definitely hard to quantify in an absolute sense and I think if you try to compare it ac across large distances you have like the same problem I mentioned with I you know people being willing to pay $80 to save the birds regardless of how many birds they're actually saving but uh like at shorter distances you can definitely say that you know like one thing has a t Times Higher mind share or A Thousand Times Higher mind share than another thing right so you know yeah I mean mind share you know internet like attention economy you know whichever of those words he wants to use like it's it's hard to quantify if to get into the details but it's definitely this like very real thing at a high level yeah so so do you think like everything is basically a mcoin and we're all just trying to figure out in real time how to Value these things and it just trades based off of you know attention that's mean that's definitely a very nonzero part of uh of value I think both you know in crypto and outside of crypto as well like I think by the same standards by which gold is a mem coin which I think get it you know to a certificant degree is I know Bitcoin and ether are as well it's a little bit more than just mind share though I mean if you um if you hear about let's say hakua meme coin and it has a lot of Mind share because that that's what the feed is doesn't mean that you want to put you know 50% of or in your case 90 90% of your net worth in into this coin so there's something deeper than just uh attention there's also a credibility and sort of like a um a longer term uh proven out I I I guess basis yeah I agree and actually yeah this is why like within the space of meme coins that are like that everyone calls meme coins like I have this long running price uh price prediction probably one of the few price predictions I can publicly give which is that I expect Doge will outperform almost all other mem coins on a fiveyear Time Horizon and uh the reason why I believe this right is that I think uh like attention you know like you can model it as being in you know like two different buckets right where one bucket is is uh the um like very short to of attention and people who like want to make a quick Buck over the course of like a month and then the other attention is like multi-year and it's exactly people who are seeing seeking stability and dependability right and if you want stability and dependability like those are not things that you can go and proove over the course of a month those are not things that you can create just by being an even smarter wi whis kid and uh you know hiring even more II winners with million doll salaries and like getting a bunch of people like a bunch of celebrity INF influencers to say stuff on Twitter right the only way to get that kind of M uh that kind of credible dependability is to just last for a long time right and I that definitely is a big part of why Bitcoin continues to be so successful right it's the only cryptocurrency that is 15 years old and uh you know it will always be the uh oldest significant cryptocurrency by at least a four year margin um I think at at this point we could call Litecoin dead right that's okay yeah so okay it'll be the you know the oldest cryptocurrency by a significant cryptocurrency by a fouryear motion I I saw you like vitalic you commented on Twitter under I think Google just announced uh you know some progress they've made on chips on um you know Quantum computing and you're trying to understand exactly what kind of calculations is uh is your estimation that you know Bitcoin will come to be at risk and will need a hard Fork at some point before ethereum or how is that looking yes okay this is uh yeah it's a good question so I think first just to kind of lay down the technical um land here right so quantum computers they break about half of the cryptography that blockchains rely on but not the other half and the half that they break can be replaced but The Replacements are about 10 times less efficient I think that's probably like the best 15 second sumary you'll get on what quantum computers do right so specifically quantum computers break elliptic curve signatures they do not break hashes um though they do do hashes somewhat more efficiently and so it's possible that qu of computers are actually going to Super centralized proof of work but like that's one of those unknown things right but the uh but then if elliptic curve signatures stop working then you have hash based signatures you have Lattis Bas signatures there's a lot of Replacements right and in ethereum we already have like a pretty detailed road map for replacing the quantum vulnerable parts of ethereum with like what the resistance pieces in the like roughly four places where that happens right so one is uh the signatures so um or signatures at consensus level um then another is uh like the data availability glovs a third is signatures at the application Level and a fourth um is going a vertical trees if we actually go in that direction and The Replacements for those are like one for Signature second sentus layer you want hash based signatures and you use Starks to aggregate them two is uh for um I forget the order which I mentioned for the blobs you basically just use again use star meral tree yeah so these are things we know how to do today right there'll be like hard Works basically that we might have to implement in in the future yes so three of them will be hard forks and then another for the account layer this is one of those reasons why I've been such a big uh like proponent of account abstraction I mean I have like four different reasons to support it right but like account abstraction is basically saying instead of your account being verified by ecdsa a native account gets verified by arbitrary evm code right and and because like obviously evm code is powerful and so it solves like four different problems at the same time right and one of those is quantum safety um so part of that is like actually having the protocol features and then part of that is uh actually like getting like users upgraded in time is Bitcoin going to need a hard Fork sooner than later given you know it's more ancient cryptography it well so Bitcoin right so Bitcoin does everything with soft Forks um and uh so what they'll need to do is they will need to add a signature scheme that is quantum resistant and the challenge is that qu resist signatures are about like 10 times bigger than elliptic curve based ones and so they will have to either increase the witness size or experience a reduction in capacity um and and uh like the the most practical way to do this stuff is to actually do cross transaction signature aggregation so basically you have you know on average something like 180 transactions in a block and then each of those transactions has its own signature and you basically replace all of those signatures with one single star that proves that the signatures exist right and that's how you save space and I think uh ethereum is able to do things like that Bitcoin theoretically can but they're going to have to get comfortable with some pretty advanced technology that they've been resisting so far and even just looking at their comments like um under on Twitter under those stories there's the question of what happens to you know satoshi's coins um like they're they're in an old address like it's a non-quantum resistant address do you just let let the hacker take the million coins do you burn them move them um is that even correct like Okay so this is uh actually kind of fun because uh if you want you can actually structure a soft Fork to make those coins safe probably um it it depends on how they were created basically the trick is that most actual users their private keys were not just created directly by a random number generator most people's private keys they were created by hashing a seed phrase and so what you do is that you basically replace the verification algorithm with a verification algorithm that says give me a stark proving that you have the seed phrase and uh I'm not sure if this works for Satoshi because uh like I think back in 2009 and 2010 probably every each individual private key was just separately randomly generated in which case like either he's screwed or he's going to have to actually move those coins and possibly reveal information about himself which is going to be interesting this is that this the issue with Bitcoin it's like um they they've been leaning on the fact of this um concept like we're not changing anything it we're going to leave everything as it is but there will be force uh points one is quantum the other one of course is just like the uh the the halvening at some point creates um possibly like you know security issue there there there will be Force at some point to like you said make tough decisions on things that maybe they would rather not deal with but some somebody collectively and then there's a coordination problem because some people will just want to let those coins get stolen some people will will want to burn them like it will be a big problem yes it's uh it definitely will yeah I think uh this is I think one of the tail risks for Bitcoin always right which is like I think they strive to have the legitimacy of gold but like the reality is that you know gold doesn't have core devs Bitcoin does and uh gold is not vulnerable to 51% of tax Bitcoin is right and so you have like a couple of these tail risk situations where quot of computers are one I think another is transaction fees just being not enough to pay for security and a third is mining centralization like basically any one of those three things could turn into a situation and if it turns into a situation then like they're going to have to scramble to solve it and like they yeah don't really have Machinery that's good for scrambling and solving right correct they don't have a consensus Machinery I mean nobody does I guess you know on the ethereum side we kind of accept that there's still some core core system that will decide but uh on the Bitcoin side they're really it would be it would be a mess yeah yeah yeah you on the ethereum side it's like five different client teams right so I think the last time actually yeah we did scramble and solve something was uh oh this is like one of those really Yeah ironic fun facts the only time that ethereum blockchain had a serious consensus failure I guess who said the transaction who caused it you it was me yes no yes basically okay so what happened was this was uh in the context of the 2016 deny of service attacks right for there basically yeah this was this really fascinating moment in history where there was some Anonymous attacker who kept on discovering every single vulnerability at ethereum clients that would cause uh blocks to be really slow to process and eventually he found a vulnerability that allowed him to just blow up the ethereum state and like fill it with 20 million empty accounts really quickly and so we had to implement a hard fork and we basically scrambled and like did an entire hard Fork from start to launch in six days and uh then part of the hard Fork involved this pretty tricky mechanism for getting rid of those 20 million EP accounts and there was this weird interaction between how that mechanism works with the revert mechanism and with promiles and like that three-way interaction there was a bug and I was the one who was sending the transactions that was actually triggering the cleanup and at some point yeah I said the one that was actually triggered you know cleaning up a a precompile that had State and uh that caused a etherum to split in half and like basically everyone scrambled and like got together and fixed it in about I think 12 hours total right so like the machinery exists um and of course uh the I mean like what we want ideally right is we want like Machinery that has legitimacy to fix technical problems but not to screw around with evm applications and uh you know as a viewer you decide whether or not we've achieved that uh vitalic we're cognizant of your time we'll we'll do a couple quick fire questions just just uh you know maybe get like one two minute kind of thoughts and then we can do our our past of the week uh Justin you w to you want to shoot one out yeah vitalic I'm building in this space on the journey to trying to find product Market fit I'm curious like have you ever thought about building a consumer app on ethereum and if you have what what's the idea and if you haven't like is it something you'd consider in the future like I definitely have ideas for applications right and you know I definitely kind of blab them out on blogs or blab them out to other people um at various times I think I mean one of the things that I've recognized about myself is like I'm definitely not the conventional you know company executive in the sense of you know I'm not the sort of Elon Musk type okay chop chop chop let's like 60 hours a week for two weeks and like force force everyone together and uh like make rapid decisions and yell at everyone who disagrees and uh and quickly fire three bords of them so it gets down faster right and like I'm definitely you know the type that's kind of more very philosopher and so you know the way for me to be productive is to not try to be that character myself but to try to like basically help Empower and help influence and give support to other people that are that archetype you prefer instead of instead of building the app you're you're happy to sort of give the ideas out and and just have other people you know go through that give the ideas uh some yeah exactly sometimes also make a demo so one of the things that I found is like people are often one of the weird ways in which people are lazy is that people are it's it lazier about like getting their sort of mental butts off the ground and doing the first 1% of a task and so I find that sometimes when I write the code to do the first 1% of a thing that's when people can then just like go and keep editing it and then from there like everything just goes further right yeah I I I I definitely have my own ways and uh my own ways are not the ways being a full-time product manager just want to ask quickly on charting vitalic like this is something as a Layman you know I don't fully know I know it was part of the road map and then it kind of got taken out but then we see I see chain like a near say they're doing charting maybe it's still possible like can you just give me like a 30 second like is charting is something wrong with it or what what's the deal ethereum with functional l2s in terms of like security properties it is functionally exactly equal to shing right like rollups are shards they are you know you can move things between l2s and l1s they have the same security property as it or something like keeping your assets safe without requiring any single user to run a node that has more than a tiny portion of all of the data and then data availability sampling which is the technology behind the blobs that's that like that's actually literally charting for the data but not for and then the way rollups work is it's like blob Shard the data and then sarcs or optimistic proof systems Shard the computation so there's like a technical sense in which they are charting I think the main reason why it doesn't feel like shorting to users is basically because we yeah from the beginning we're not on the ball in terms of the standards and interoperability problem right and like that's an actual issue that we have to go and solve and like actually create know the common languages and make sure that the Els and the wallets speak it right and so with in the EF actually for the past like half year we've been growing a team whose goal it is to like be much more directly engaged both with l2s and wallets and users um so Josh Rudolph has been doing a lot of that and then I think it's a a combination of Josh together with you know Yola who's the account abstraction person and he has a lot of experience like directly interfacing with you know wallets and applications and the user side of the ecosystem but before we get into pasta you know we've talked a lot about the future of ethereum we've heard your vision for it we've also seen your road map independently here and you've sort of shared that if we complete all of these stages of the road map ethereum will sort of mostly be there it'll mostly be finished have you thought about what is next for you I mean ethereum has sort of been your life mission for many many years now like do you picture yourself riding off into the sunset after shipping this road map that you've proposed do you think you'll always be working on ethereum or do you think you'll be doing something else in the future yeah I mean my uh like my interest definitely know go beyond ethereum right and uh I think this year the things beyond ethereum that have been successful are I mean one obviously like zo turning into its own thing and the way that I think about that is like it's a a a physical um environment and physical Community for people that are like actually interested in trying out know governance mechanisms different kinds of Technologies cryptographic social this is zalu right the sort of meup event that occurs over several months in various fun places exactly so the uh like for me the the the Practical goal of this is basically to like actually instantiate a a sort of sci-fi Universe where you can actually take all of the things that we're working on and like basically deploy them at the same time when and sort of think Tech steps ahead within a community that's willing to make that effort um also the the the diac movement is one right so I published this post on techno optimism about a year ago and uh so my intention there was basically that uh like I think the surrounding kind of political and social philosophy behind uh crypto and Bitcoin like you know I I talked a bit earlier about how I'm and happy about some of the nihilism and one of my intuitions behind why is basically that there are ideas that are 15 years old that haven't really been updated right so if you think of the Bitcoin Genesis block right the thing that it says in the header is like I think it's like the times 3 January 2009 chanell war on break of second bailout for banks right and it was like very focused on the ills of the financial systems and Banks and bailouts and those things are important but if you just go out and ask a person today what are the top 10 issues plaguing the world then the stuff that Bitcoin people were saying in 2009 and 2011 like that doesn't really resonate right like if you think about you know Global political issues if you think about like misinformation if you think or freedom of speech um social media being broken um if uh you think about you know AI um but social inequality is one of those 10 issues right balic and social inequality you could say is related to you know how money is being printed and where it goes and K on it is M exactly um yeah I mean so okay so I do think that like money printing in particular is probably responsible for like less than 10% of that but I do like in countries outside of you know the the West like having access to a financial system that just like Works internationally like is huge and it's very important right so like I personally use crypto for international donations all the time as well right but um so and then I you know I visited places like you know Argentina turkey you know different our African countries you know Ukraine like I've definitely seen firsthand how when other things break the you know crypto payments sort of thing that does not break and I think that's important but I think like there's value in viewing it as part of this bigger picture and like I think if we want to have narrative that can really engage people on that level like I think it's important to really bring in some of those other things as well right and so the B the question I answered in my post on techno optimism is basically like what is a good path for technology in general to go that does not um like one is not sort of you know European style degrowth stagnation ISM and like let's solve problems by going back to living in cottages and two is not kind of accelerationism into blowing up the world and three also is not something that just leades to like massive centralization of power I mean on on the accelerationism like uh I saw Jeremy from Circle and he predicts that in three years most of the stable coin transactions will be done by AI agents not by humans and is that something that is that is that techno Optimist or or is that um is that scary like and and do you think that that's true like will block will will ethereum be mainly used by agents in in a few years yeah so this is like AI is crazy hard to predict right and uh like when uh I was on 80,000 hours earlier this year which is one of those big effective outro list podcasts and like they ask me for predictions and I basically I think said that my 95% confidence interval for the singularity is I think 2029 to 2200 and like this is of course crazy wide and like some people say like what you think it's going to happen in 2029 and other people say what you think there is a realistic possibility we're not going to be at a singularity by 2200 and uh but the reality is like the future is crazy hard to predict right and I think everyone was surprised on the positive side by yeah you know gpt2 and then gpt3 and Dolly and all of that but then on the flip side I think I mean I don't know about you guys but like I personally actually feel a bit disappointed relative to expectations maybe I should say Rel given my kind of cautious leanings but like like in terms of what's happened since GPT right like there's been lots of actual progress but it definitely feels like a slow down compared to the trajectory right I mean some Sam Alman has been telling us that he thinks that in his view the world's not going to change that even if we get AGI or whatever he thinks that the day-to-day it will be less different than people think it would be quite similar to the current world yeah okay this is uh this this is a good discussion right because I think this is importance to get into like theories of how the world changes right which is that there's a lot of things that don't change until suddenly a big thing happens and uh as a result they do change right so uh Dan Carin this you know a famous history podcaster he has a big series of podcasts uh on World War I like literally 24 hours talking about World War I I actually listened to like almost the whole thing while I was going on a walk from water lud Toronto you know like very perfect duration match there about 23 hours but it one the point that he made was that uh World War I was a war where they went in with horses and they came out with tanks right and uh but I kind of think among historians there's like a meme that really the 19th century started in 1789 the 20th century started in you like somewhere between 1911 and 1918 and uh I think the 21st Cy started started somewhere between 2020 and 2023 um so the two bookends there being co and gbt 4 I think like pretty unambiguously passing the touring test basically I could definitely see a world where technology yeah advances and then you have this like period of stability and this period of like growing disequilibrium but then eventually like someone does something or some event happens that just pushes things and then as soon as everyone gets out of their comfort zones like suddenly everything starts changing and like things can get pretty crazy like I think there are a lot of unknowns in how I is going to work and I think like it's really worth acknowleding that like I could see a world where the economy is just crazy AI dependent in 2027 I could also see a world where just for example um AI take over and as a result we don't even need to have an economy anymore I could also see a world where AI become super influential but the way that they coordinate doesn't really end up involving much of an economy yeah do you have a view over like the next 10 years what's going to have a greater impact AI or crypto and another way to ask that is if you're a young software engineer that's inspired and wants to be in Tech like do you think the best opportunity for them is AI or crypto or something entirely different question one AI question two crypto um basically yeah I think like for question one you know you know I think you do have to kind of be humble and just realistically accept you know the average person's life over the last like five years has been transformed much more by generative AI than it has been by crypto right and like crypto is very big and crypto is very significant but like AI is just huge right and I think you know we should uh sort of know acknowledge that fact right and so this is why like for me yeah for the primary competition is not like ethereum versus a specific other blockchain it's like the crypto space at all have being able to like actually have an impact and have its values expressed in the context of this world where people are like literally racing to build super intelligence and then you know getting enthusiastic about military applications and then just like all kinds of crazy stuff right uh so the and that the reason why I say crypto for the second is because like AI does have all of the uh like default attention right now right like I think in general I think this was not true in 2021 right but I definitely notice a vibe in like non- crypto circles I think this accelerated in 2022 like I remember I was visiting run you know in the the famous you know AI Twitter influencer right TS zzo um and he told me that hey doesn't it I feel like I've been getting much more bearish on crypto doesn't it seem like crypto doesn't really make much sense anymore and like that was even before FTX right after FTX that mentality accelerated and like I think people have been there's a lot of people watching on the sidelines like basically waiting like hey is crypto actually going to be meaningful and one of the reasons why I'm just excited about poly Market is that in these Circles of like these mainstream intellectuals I follow even among the Skeptics like there are people who casually tweet things like oh crypto as useless but then they turn around and they yeah tweet screenshots of poly market right so it's like poly Market is was very consequential this year and and uh I think like it's yeah so basically compared to where a lot of the non- crypto Vibe is I think crypto is quite underrated moment and you would say like yeah like so basically as a young software developer you can still have a lot of impact um sort of BU building in in the category um guys let's let's hop to Pasta the week we'll we'll wrap up with a few uh a few tweets and vitalic will be our judge today so uh hope you've chosen carefully ta you w to go first this is a big one this is a big one uh I you know I went for you know Max size here but you know I I forget when this photo uh circulated um on Twitter but you know following this photo I think the price of ethereum Pumped 5% uh so you know my question to you is you know is your size size okay I mean you know what like actually happened there right I think I mentioned it in a post later like basically there was a yeah like a rolled up USB key in my pocket at the time you don't have to be so humble ballic you don't have to be so humble next that's the story and we're sticking to it okay tyi we're sticking to the story it's a USB key the it's a valid attempt I'm I'm I'm going to play it a bit safer I I'll go to one of my regulars which is Gart I'm gonna have a Gart pasta so I I saw uh Brian Johnson briyan Johnson sent a tweet that uh he says oh I think I'm winning I think I'm gonna win I think I'm winning so Bryant so basically we have the you know the usual chain Chain Reaction effect and it starts with Satoshi proposing uh peer-to-peer transactions and it ends with Brian Johnson uh tweeting that there is an active betting Market on his nighttime erections now in po market so this is this is where we've uh are you playing that market velic yeah I am not I mean in terms of like the humor value I I love the inversion right in the sense of like the Brian Johnson tweet us the sort of thing where like if you being if you were being serious about it you would belong on the bottom and then the sitution Koto thing would belong on the top but here it's kind of backwards you know it's fine I think I'm going to win all right Justin you go so I don't know if you guys saw the uh bit boy vers anom boxing match I think the two of them this is now their second crypto uh fight night that they've participated in I don't know if you've seen these falic here uh but uh solo says am I the only one that saw this during the fight is it me or did anom and Ben Armstrong make out passionately and it's this AI mat up here after their boxing match the AI is getting it's getting crazy the AI is just insane yeah yeah they are yeah I uh I mean I've like followed a little bit I mean I in my one of my posts this February it was the one that was titled ask security questions um I I linked in there to an mp4 that someone on Twitter made of like myself tweeting like it was like myself and Alex Reedman up but with the audio like edited and I think probably even lips sneak it sound like I was um promoting some random shitcoin so yeah yeah yeah that's uh yeah this stuff is uh definitely getting are are you do you watch the the crypto fight nights at all or is like is that something you would ever participate in I do not um me either maybe chess boxing if it was chest boxing Maybe yeah yeah I mean I think as uh I think it was uh my I I think this was my mom's ex-husband or like some family member told me yeah the standard martial arts advice is that the uh best way the best way to win a fight is to run away from it and know I've been doing my 20ks lately so I don't know is is is that is that like two beta for this channel do I need to like have more people no it's stage advice it's stage advice okay okay no that's yeah I mean crypto fight nights but we should also do like crypto chess night and then maybe a crypto Marathon night and and just like have have we should have Charles hoskinson run at 20K and see how that goes that'll be [Music] [Laughter] interesting all right I got the approval metalic who who who is the past of the week winner yeah yeah I'll I'll I'll take the bran Johnson one okay all right I get I get the chef hat for this one it seemed to get the it got the strongest the strongest laugh cool well vitalic thank you so much for joining we've been excited to have you for a long time and we're glad that we made this happen um thanks so much and um hope hope our audience enjoyed it yeah no thank you guys too yep catch you soon catch you soon see everybody next week bye bye see you [Music] [Music]",

    "content": "hello and welcome to the green pill. network podcast if you're just joining us we're building a coordination a network Society of thousands of hackers streamers and tourers focused on using crypto to bring positive sum digital systems to the world this podcast features the people who are doing it and uh if you want to learn more you can visit our website at Green pill. Network where you can download the green pill book for free join the Discord or become a member of your local green pill. Network chapter now on with the show all right this is part two of my special series with v Brer in about public goods funding at the end of 2025 in part one we talked about the Tal's Broadview of the design space as we go from 2024 to 2025 what are the things that Builders should be focused on and in part two of this two episode series we talk about deep funding. org which is a new experiment that the gitcoin ecosystem is building with vitalics Guidance the G I should say the gitcoin and general public goods funding ecosystem is building there's a bunch of us who are building part of this ecosystem and the amazing thing is the money Legos that have been produced that allows a bunch of teams to work together to implement vitalic Vision so in this episode we talk about vitalic vision for deep funding and uh a tldr for you before you get into the upod is that deep funding uses dependency graph in a market of AI or human allocators steered by a spot checking jury to pay a large number of Open Source contributors directly or indirectly Upstream of a project or outcome that a funder cares about okay so we're doing deep funding no more of this surface level funding that only if people know about it doesn't get funding we're looking at dependency graphs we're using AI agents in order to figure out which projects have dependencies in what ways on on other things so this is a really bold experiment in public H funding I'm so excited to be unveiling it today on the green pill podcast um so uh the next voice you will hear will be myself introducing Devon inel as my co-host for the episode and then we will get the conversation with vitalic about deep funding. org I think you're really going to enjoy this episode [Music] all right here we are uh Devon you want to start off with an intro of yourself and then stage all and then we will get into our questions for vitalic thanks for getting me on this my name is Devan and I work in arbitrium Dow governance and in general Dow governance and also public goods and um something I I was an investigative reporter by training and I think like the values of censorship resistance speaking truth to power really have a home in the blockchain space that's what got me into it first thanks Sean go ahead SEL hi I'm SEL and I work as grants Innovation specialist at gitcoin my work fly involves in sort of Designing the grand programs with the ecosystems and I led the first ezr pgf pilot with gitcoin with protocol Labs cell and pocket and really interested in exploring the different ways of uh Capital allocation well we are here today to talk about deep funding which is a new experiment that we've been cooking up and um I'm going to sit in the background as uh SEL and Devon ask vitalic about deep funding and the inspiration behind it so you all take the Reigns and I'll take them back in about 15 or 20 minutes as we're wrapping up go ahead okay yeah that's great I maybe start with the first question so vitalic this is like clearly something you've been thinking about for quite some time so I guess like what is the problem that caused you to start looking into it what is the uh kind of what is the mechanism itself and why deep uh fun the name yeah so to me deep funding has two core um insights that distinguish it from a lot of the previous like funding mechanisms right so one of them is deep in the sense of like a deep graph and the other is deep in the sense of deep learning right so we can get into both of these right so when you say the Deep graph right the core of the mechanism is basically that you have this dependency graph so this graph of projects and how much value each project provides to each other project and this graph can have multiple levels to it and the idea of moving from a frame of public goods funding to a frame of dependency graphs is something that I've observed in like Commons and like Public Funding discour especially over the last year right and to me the reason why like in intuitively it should work is or it should work better is that like public goods funding in general has this problem of being this like fairly far mode thing right it's like oh you don't know we're how much value does this thing provide to humanity right it's like how what is the dollar value that um you know the pi ECC piun Library provides to humanity or provides to theorum like how the hell do you even calculate that right um but the question of how how much credit does a deserve for b or how relatively speaking how much more valuable is a for B than C is for B those are questions that are somewhat more tractable right and uh if you break down the know relatively intractable thing into more tractable things uh then uh like you're going to be able to get higher quality answers right and there's like a lot of psychological research that shows that that you know we're much more irrational at relatively far mode things we're also more irrational about uh you know giving absolute numbers than at you know giving relative answers right it's like the famous you know scope and sensitivity question like if you ask people how many dollars they would pay to save 2,000 burds versus 200,000 burds versus two uh 20,000 burds it turns out the answer that they give is like $80 in all of those cases right and so you know you wants to avoid like that kind of thing right and sometimes like Public Funding has a bad name precisely because it gets attached to these uh know like very big challenges and even determining like what is a thousand times more valuable or a thousand times less valuable right so breaking into graphs the second part is uh like the debling part right so in my post on info Finance I have a section that's distilled human judgment and the section there basically suggests like hey you know we have these powerful AIS so how about we basically use AI as an accelerator right I basically think of it as that you know you have an existing mechanism that is expensive but that is credibly neutral and or at least that you can that has a lot of legitimacy and that you trust and then you use AI to try to get something that is almost as good as that mechanism but that can be extremely performant right and so think of it as like AIS being the uh engine and this human based mechanism being the steering wheel right and so the the way this would work is that you fill in this graph and then you would have a human mechanism that spot checks the graph in a few random places and it basically takes gives out a final answer that is based on the AI given answers in proportion to how closely they match to human preferences on the specific subsite that the humans actually check right and so you can structure this in different ways like you could structure it as a prediction Market where eyes are participating or you could create a somewhat a somewhat simpler structure you can make an analogy to rlf here right but like that's the the core idea right of like AI providing the scale but then the some human mechanism that is more expensive per query but where you make relatively few queries is the thing that is providing the direction yeah I'm curious if uh you know what are the some unintended consequences of deep funding yeah I mean I guess this is uh one of the things that we're going to find out right um because uh I think one of the new things that deep funding uh does is H it does introduce this like contest nature to it right where you have people using AIS that are providing and like these big uh like million uh number you know graph lightings that basically say you know like this is the percent allocation going from this to this and it's like a competitive mechanism right like people are competing to give answers that are the closest to what the human jury end up selecting and like if you do a better job on the competition then you know you like get a bigger prize yourself right and like I think competitions like that like very Str like structured competitions they could give a lot of value right and like I mean when I was in high school I participated fed in programming competitions quite a bit and like they were really fun and I enjoyed them right and like they they can be great for really focusing attention but at the same time like any kind of mechanism has adversarial incentives in it always has like unintended ways in which it's uh ends up uh breaking um so that's like one place where I would uh look for uned consequences like if you want to ask the question of like where if I was told a year from now that that the mechanism broke like where does it break I would say one of my answers would be well maybe it just turns out that even doing these like short range uh like spot checking answers uh questions of like how valuable is a for B like maybe even those answers are actually like very hard for human beings to answer reliably enough uh so that's a concern um or potentially maybe the problem of G becomes like just too hard to get past right and when you have AIS people are going to start gaining the AIS and of course there's like very basic like Noob level stuff that you can do like making 500 commits instead of five commits right but the the theory is of course that like human spot cheing judges are going to be able to cap to see that and take that into account and so that creates the incentive for people to make models that see it and that take into account right but then the question is like like is that whole balance actually going to work and like I don't know that's something I would look for I mean otherwise the that question is that you know it's it's definitely pretty open-ended so I mean I'd also be interested to hear from uh you know you3 like what what are areas in which you expect unintended consequences might come I think the biggest danger might be in how software development itself is done we've already seen maintainers come under a lot of stress after they tried sneaking in a back door vulnerability so I'm concerned that it might lead to people not including dependencies or like kind of changing up their internal Dynamics I feel that's the thing I'm most concerned about yeah I think this is what I can think of like you know um will they end up choosing which dependency to use which to not use and you know how will that play out so yeah I mean I think uh the like like if I had to robot the the standard robot it's like we're not comparing against Nirvana we're comparing against the Alternatives right and like in private markets uh you know there's definitely a phenomenon where you choose which software you use not just by the quality of the software by by you know what terms they offer and you know like whether or not like what their monetization strategy is so it's uh like get it like avoiding those kinds of uh interactions is definitely a crazy uh hard problem and I another area of course is that's to like M for possible you know like places where stuff can fail as like peerto peer or um academic peer review and citations and you know citation rings and that sort of thing um I think the next question is somewhat related which is that we've seen cases of the government using AI models and it's gone very wrong like to give two examples in Netherlands the Child Welfare Department used an algorithm and it denied benefits and asked for money back and the Prime Minister St down um so kind of I wonder if like how is this mechanism different from some of the existing initiatives that we've seen where governments are trying to use AI for filtering and eligibility and whatnot okay so so this uh this question is uh good because I think it it gets to the core of part of the answer just has to be not just the mechanism but also our expectations about the mechanism right and I think we generally yeah we have this political culture possibly in the west possibly globally where like private is equated with risk-taking and public is equated with uh providing guarantees and providing certainty and providing procedural fairness and like from a logical perspective like those two axes definitely do not have to uh be like coincide with each other right but like in our culture um you know if uh like Elon Musk um you know goes and does something and you know gives like $40,000 to one influencer not another influencer and you know we have no idea what kind of manipulation is happening in there then like this is accepted but then if a government you know denies instead of uh accepting then that's uh treated as a a bigger problem I mean I think welfare payments like specifically right are definitely something you want to be careful with because like the goal of welfare is definitely like fundamentally risk averse right because the goal is to like make sure that people have enough for you know Healthcare and food and basic expenses and like you don't want welfare to look like startup returns right but uh if we're thinking of uh public goods funding right then uh that's not a necessarily a thing where we even want to try to optimize for like maximum stability and I like maximum guarantee that like if you follow the rules then you're going to get things right and I think I know there's even an argument that like precisely the thing that our civilization is missing is the opposite right which is basically yeah you know this ability to potentially get really lucky and get like a lot of reward and recognition for doing something super valuable um and so I think one part of the answer is like we maybe we needs to just be culturally more willing to accept more risk in public goods funding and then another part of the answer of course uh is like the question of where we use it right and like there are people who want the form factor of getting like a stable tenure job and there are people who want the form factor of um you know go big go big or go home and like there's people who have those preferences for psychological reasons and then there's people who want that stability because they just you know are poor have big families or medical conditions and things outside their control and so I think like both preferences are valuable and there need to be things that serve both right and like we should also just accept that any individual mechanism should not is not meant to be this master mechanism that serves everybody right like if you think about protocol Guild right like protocol Guild feels much more tenure like right in protocol Guild is not going to just that go and suddenly deny your money because like a cosmic rate hit and a bit a bit flipped in an llm somewhere right and so I yeah like I believe in having a diversity of mechanisms I yeah believe in having different mechanisms for different goals and different groups of people and so the whole can be very like very diverse very balanced and very fair without like putting the responsibility of each on each individual part soci short that responsibility yeah Love It Go b or go home for sure I would love to know like what are some of the other use cases that you can see or think of for deep funding other than software and GitHub yeah okay so here we so far we've been talking about S software developments um one interesting use case could be art right um so I think especially in the age of AI art has very complicated dependency graphs and like if you probably yeah can do analysis to try to like at least probabilistically figure out like oh you know this piece of art was like actually 2.3% inspired by Game of Thrones that like somehow worked its way into some model and like total violation of copyright laws but whatever it's in there and you know I think realistically like you can't stop that right but if you can create a structure that does like an as good job as possible of like fig figuring out this incredibly complicated you know dependency and credit relationships in art and like trying to compensate people in different parts of that PIP plan as much as possible like I think that would be really cool then I mean like the research and idea space uh obviously I mean that's like an interesting one right because it's like somewhat more illegible um like if you think about the question of like who um you know invented amms right and I know if you go through the history there's like a piece of the contribution that Heiden made a piece of the contribution that I made a piece of the contribution that Bor people made a piece that Martin cman made and then ultimately a piece that Robin Hansen made right and then you know each of those characters also have their own influences but then you know we see that AI is like actually very good at making the illegible legible right yeah I famously have the example in my post earlier this year on uh the like draw a bitcoiner versus draw in ethereum and like the bitcoiner is this person who was like enjoying like floating in a sea of gold coins and the ethereum is like wearing these cyber goggles and you have like blue and you like can NE on lights and computers everywhere right so uh so yeah the idea generation as a a good uh space What even uh like what other media even are there eips are a challenging one right because it's like you want to be careful about funding specific eips because you know you don't want the sort of corrupt the neutrality of the protocol process and you don't wants to like give people incentives to just keep like pushing things in like I think the ones that I mentioned are probably the big ones I mean are there are there any others that you guys can think of yeah I think one of the things we've been talking about is Sciences dependency probably covered that like you know how we can you know trck that and have a citation graph and see what that would look like and if this is something that can be used for that we are super interested seeing if that can work out yep I think the biggest challenge is the structured data because GitHub has it very nicely organized and the rest of the world doesn't so I just think that's the challenge that's the hump need to get over in applying it anywhere else yeah I'll move on to the next question which is um how can people get involved in this pilot it's a very new mechanism so what are the different ways that people can start getting involved and actually contribute to making it a success yeah so the mechanism right as we've mentioned it has two parts right it has know the engine and the steering wheel and I think you know the steering wheel basically is a you know human judgment making decisions about some like random spot checks of particular questions and there's a lot of nuance in doing that steering wheel task well and uh you know like the details of how that works I'm sure we'll get figured out you know over the next one through two but this is the sort of thing that you know people that have been involved in like funding uh onchain and offchain before can totally get into and then the other side of things is the engine part right which is basically yeah like the problem you're solving is you're given a graph and your job is to basically fill the graph the edges of the graph in with numbers from zero to one such that the edges going into a particular node add up to a number that's less than one right it's you know mathematically one of those very simple problem statements right but then the the challenge is like how do you do that in a way that actually lines up with you know this ground truth signal that that you'll be getting from the yes spot checks and I mean to me it's like the the way to think of it is like it is a fun programming competition right it's that's basically yeah you know what it is right you're like writing a bot uh to play a game like that's you know I did that when I was 16 it was really fun um and basically try your hand that this'll figure out how much you can do so the prizes I me know get I'm sure that'll appear more in the dock right but one of the things is that like we'll split it into two categories where there's like a fairly programmatic prize for getting a high score and then there is a kind of softer prize for just making public submissions that are useful and including useful to to you know people interested in mechanism but also including useful to other contestants so open interpretable models um you know like data V visualizers uh like tools help people train um you know tools that help people gather other pieces of information like pretty much anything um and so there's uh like both sides of that like you know we definitely don't want this to be one of these sort of like fully opaque competition so trying to encourage some collaboration too yeah I do think that's one of the biggest differences with the example I gave of government where it's a fully opaque process only one person is developing a model and that's too much power and here it's like everyone is participating and even if we mess up we can be like hey sorry like we did our best please tell us where and make a GitHub commit to improve you know our process so like you're going to give more specific call to actions at Deep funding. RG and um we really hope that we get a lot of submissions in the model and like vitalik has been very generous as well in uh kind of being the gardener who actually the ground and makes the soil fertile for this to happen so we're really grateful to have your brain thinking on these issues there's going to be a telegram group link on the website so please join the telegram and also refer people if you know people in your community if you know academics whoever who can submit models so please refer to them and they can also participate so maybe a last fun question before we go do you have a favorite Underdog public goods project that deep funding can uncover and support I mean one um example that I keep coming back to is that in one of the optimism retal funding rounds we funded ketak right so like literally the developers who actually invented the hash function that all of eum sits uh on top of in the uses today and that's something that is like Beyond uh you know the cryptocurrency world though it's uh obviously part of cryptography right and and it's something that is you know very critical right but like I think you know people doing that kind of you know cryptography that's like so Bas level like even stretches uh far beyond the cryptocurrency world and value like they need to be funded to and uh I think it was amazing that we were able to right I mean one of the things that I think you sent me Devon was know the the famous internet meme of like software being this like very big tower of very different blocks where there's like one little piece that's maintained by some random guy in Nebraska right uh so I think uh you know things in that category are the kinds of things that I would be excited about unearthing and supporting walk do you have any question just want to end by thanking you all for being uh my rer die group of mechanism designers and um pilot designers here so really excited about the program um and I want to thank ballic for being on the episode so one thing that I've personally felt while being part of this pilot you know theyan and have discussed this like the pace at which this is happening right so this is the speed that you know we have the speed that we have experienced is is incredible so what do you suggest like how we can you know do this more right with other mechanisms because that is something that you know we all recognize is needed right so would love to know your thoughts there yeah me I think uh like what we need is I mean one is definitely like some Financial Resources like I think in addition to you know like funding rounds that where your goal is to fund a particular space like we should just have more resources that go into funding experimental rounds where a bigger part of the purpose is uh like just getting experience around a particular rounds but in addition to that I think another piece is like really yeah getting more intellectual Capital involved like actually creating things that people can be excited about and that once to participate in and that can and contribute Awards and uh that's something where like I think this is what theoretically one of the benefits of some of these like more democratic and participatory mechanisms right it's like if you give a lever for to a whole bunch of people to participate then like that gets done involved and uh you know that's a also uh they end up being involved in you know some of the other parts and in like the meta of improving the mechanism as well right so I think on top of just encouraging that I think ecosystem wide really talking more about funding as a first class thing is something that I want to be doing more of in 2025 as well amazing all right this is going to be my second attempt to bring the episode to a close vitalic thank you thank you for joining us SEL Deon thank you for being my ride or die friends working on this pilot together very excited about public goods funding into 2025 uh thanks everyone for your time and we we will see you at Deep funding. org Welcome to our outro after the show with vitalic buin where we introduced deep funding. org SEL Devon what did you all think of the episode with metallic I think like he covered such a breath of topics that it's like you it's like oh W this was only 15 minutes like can't understand like how we covered like things from how the mechanism Works which he broke down as dependency grafts as being one element and the second element was the spot checks uh and I think that was useful and then he moved on to how its applications to government uh and different mechanisms and art and Industry so I think like it's a pretty exciting new way and I I like his reframing of public goods funding to dependency crafts because I a lot of people have felt that public goods funding is overused so I think it's a new it's it's an exciting new direction to move into yeah I think for me I um definitely love the direction I'm most excited about tapping into other communities which are just not web3 so the AI communities right so I think that intersection is we've already talked so much about it we seeing that wave in web 3 but you know bringing those that crowd in is something that I'm really looking forward to and making it so open right like it's such an open market thing and the content test like anybody can come and um you know submit the model without any gatekeeping that is something that I'm you know also really looking forward to and I'll be interested to explore like how he said you know we should uh discuss funding as a first class in ecosystems in next year so definitely want to you know with some of the work we're doing in Alo and I want to see how we can uh you know continue doing that and um yeah those are few things that I'm really looking forward to one of the things that's that's kind of struck me that I just think is really cool uh I've been in this game for seven years and um what I see when I look back in time is an increase in velocity of mechanism design going to Market and you know I actually I asked vitalic to do this podcast about two weeks ago um and originally I was just going to interview him do my annual yearly interview with vitalik about what should public goods Builders focus on and I think within that two weeks this deep funding. org experiment has come together and really taken shape and now we're announcing it and uh it's it's going to happen and it's this lean pilot and I think the speed to Market is is the thing that is is sort of exciting to me about this here if we can pull together something like this you know taking balic mechanism design and like getcoins resources for going to Market I think we're going to explore the design space in a really exciting way so um you know deep funding itself is is exciting but I also want the audience to see the increasing pace of experimentation in the web 3 design space I think we're we're starting to move a lock step towards figuring out how to allocate public goods funding and that's really exciting to me yeah and I think one thing I do want to mention that I've experienced like this network first approach that you know we are exploring like working with Devan and even Oso PSE and all our other uh you know Partners the way all of this has come together is incredible and this speed can only be achieved you know when we have this approach so I just want to encourage everyone who has any idea who wants to do anything like we want to collaborate with you and we want to make it happen so yeah just so the audience audience might not know what network first uh means but basically at getcoin we've been talking about how do we partner with our network of Builder and mechanism designers to assemble resources on demand in order to manifest the pilot uh as opposed to um working with a centralized Dev team that can only do one thing and has to sequence things in a road map so uh the network first approach to building I think allows more fluidity in experiments that come together and if you're an ecosystem that wants to that has a crazy idea kind of like you know vitalic idea for deep funding then getcoin is here to work for you uh into with you in in rolling out that mechanism so just a little bit more color on that Network first direction that get coin's moving in in 2025 yeah just to add to that I think like what's being great about this is we've been able to work with organizations who spent their entire just thinking about this problem so for example gitcoin has been thinking about mechanisms for a very long time so they were like a great partner to build it with and SEL has been amazing at that uh open source Observer has been looking at taking GitHub data and analyzing it and dependency graphs between code repos so we've been able to work with them on the data layer we've had like you know we're hosting the competition on kaggle which is like a data science platform so again like they have the natural home for it and they have the entire infrar ready pairwise has been looking at comparison and voting which we need for the spot check so they've like already made so many mistakes which we don't need to repeat if we want to build it from scratch uh and finally drips like how do we get funding to people who are working on GitHub if they don't have wallets and they can and like drips has managed to crack that you know they can claim it whenever they want so I think the advantage of a network first approach is really that you're working with people who've already spent their entire kind of work life thinking about that problem and that has a lot of advantages in not repeating mistakes that have already happened um I think that one of the things that vitalic dropped in the podcast that I recorded with him the part one uh was talking about this idea of public good Legos um this idea that quadratic funding and the Cil resistance upon it which depends and then retr funding and then futur Archy and then things like Oso that provide data um are all money Legos but like they're public goods money Legos and it's in the permutations of combining all of these things together I should mentioned radical drips since you just said it super fluid giveth I can't name drop everyone but uh you know who you are out there um it's in the permutations of all the different things that you can assemble with these Legos that I think is going to support the build the accelerating pace of building in this space uh because there's going to be so much off the shelf that you can do that you've never been able to do before and I think that um this ecosystem because of the Legos that we can take off the shelf if there's end Legos there's nend squared permutations of ways that you can put them together and this means that if you're a hacker that wants to work on public goods funding in web 3 you can build more in a weekend than a centralized government is was able to do with $100 million and you know an army of of a thousand uh C Civic software Engineers 10 years ago and so it's the accelerating Pace uh the exponential pace of of innovation enabled by these Legos that I think it's really exciting and and pair that with a network first approach I think that's how deep funding is going to come together and hopefully be a successful pilot and um and hopefully we're going to accelerate our PL list exploration of this design space in 2025 so it's need to come together and I think that I'm just so thankful to vitalic for providing the vision uh and then also you know the some of the funding for for Pilots like this to boldly move the space forward well uh we've only got a couple more minutes left should we talk at the object level about deep funding. org uh and direct the audience's attention there so deep funding. org is the pilot experiment and uh do we have do we have dates for it yet do we know uh do we know what uh people can see on the landing page now and what they will see when the pilot launches yeah I'm happy to take a first crack at the Timeline that we worked on with SEL um so we're going to be having the competition open on December 12th and basically what you have on December 12th is the is the dependency graph without the weights so you have 40,000 connections between different repos that make ethereum what it is so you have that graph and you have some data which drips has got on the waiting of a subset of these uh of this graph so you have something to get started and you have to like fill in the blanks you know that's your challenge and that's your prompt which you have to build a model on on Jan 20th we'll be giving you some data from the jwy if you building a deep learning solution for filling in the weights you can use this data which was released on Jan 20th to actually train your model and on Feb 20th you'll be closing submissions so and and and then we'll use the jury data between Jan 20th and Feb 20th that data is going to uh determine the winner so that's kind of a rough timeline and hope to announce the winners at shelling point in Denver so that's going to be an exciting announcement there yeah um and one more thing that I want to add that we are also launching a primer series um the first session is on December 17th which is going to be on shapley values so the idea is you know we start getting into some of the academic papers which complement this pilot because we also need a very strong foundation in depth of what what we are building and what we are doing that is going to come from this so you know when you join the telegram group link through the website you will have you'll get all the details about this primer Series so yeah lots happening and lots coming up so looking forward to having all of you uh in the group and working together all right call to action time uh if you are interested in getting involved in the Deep funding ecosystem go to deep funding. org and check it out today and if you interested in having a custom mechanism built for your ecosystem get in touch with myself SEL or Devon and then any other call to actions as we're wrapping come point in Denver come to shelling point in Denver yep uh shelling point. getcoin doco is where you can go to learn more about that well Devon SEL uh thank you again for being my ride or die homies on this and excited for the pilot I am here for deep funding. org and um uh we will see you after the episode Peace [Music] he",

    "content": "um I have a very short question on layer 2's for you what are your thoughts and again briefly on the growing fragmentation across layer 2os I think um this is one of those challenging questions because part of the vision of layer 2s has always been to try to enable independent experimentation and like for example if uh you really like the salon VM and you know he wants to be in ethereum lands well like great like make a salana rollup right um if uh you know you wants to you really really need parallelization and you don't care about having an evm then like great use fuel and like fuel has been like fully trustless for years now um you know you want to try do things with wasam like great we have ARB stylist and you can go write a contract with wasam and interact with other people who have contracts written in the evm and like there's a lot of value from that but at the same time there is a need for standardization and a need for basic interoperability um for wallets to be possible for account contion wallets to be possible uh for just like azures standards to work um for it to be clear which tokens are the real ones uh for like what which which usdc is the real usdc if you send me usdc on a layer two I've never even heard of before like how do I even know that is usdc and you're not trying to fake me uh so that's uh yeah actually solving those uh problems is uh like really challenging and but I think there is also a need for some kind of standardization and the thing that we have to standardize I think is going to have to be more expansive and like stricter than um just saying like everyone has to support like private and public keys but it's going but it should be also something that is looser than um you know like hey everyone has to be has to have an evm right and like there is some middle ground that captures the things that we want to standardize and leaves open room for Innovation on everything else on top and I hope that we can have the way TW come together and really kind of decide like what that set of Standards is going to be yeah",

    "title": "Vitalik Buterin&#39;s responds to Anatoly",
    "content": "and um two weeks ago we had a chat with an Natalie and and he said this is a quote the difference between salana uh difference between a Solana conference and an ethereum conference is that at a Solana conference there's way less talk about scaling um so when do you think we'll see a shift from the current sort of infrastructure Focus to a use case specific applications being maybe the dominant talking point yeah and what do I think about this I think [Music] um the chall the challenging thing about use cases is that like talking more about use cases doesn't mean like that necessarily mean that you get working use cases right like I remember how you know back in 2020 and 2021 I you know we had all of this uh excitement about like you know the games and like Axel infinity and like all of these nft projects and uh there's a like a lot of that stuff ended up not really panning out at all right and you know we saw basically that like people are trying to basically use the casino as a substitute for making a game that's fun and like that's something that where you can convince yourself into believing that it works in a bull market but then once the bare Market starts the casino stops automatically giving giving everyone money it starts losing everyone money and then if the fun isn't there then like pretty much everyone is going to get bored and leave right and so it's the the sort of thing where like on the application side it's it's really important to both like take things slowly and to recognize that sometimes a lot of the valuable applications are going to be kind of the boring ones and even that like there's a lot of like fundamentals and research questions that we have to think about when you think about applications right so like for example there's a lot of discussion around like what is the right kind of Dow and uh the right kind like that that is an application Level question but it's also a deeply technical question and you know if you get it wrong then you're going to make Dow that break um if uh a lot of the discussion around ZK like actually you know ZK voting is is a really powerful Dow governance tool um a lot of the uh discussion um around you know like Advanced cryptography like that stuff is incredibly useful for um zass like that's a very a very application Level thing right um decentralized social you know very application Level thing um so I think it's happening um and but I think it's the sort of thing that like you also can't rush and you need to have the fundamentals be there in a really strong and really reliable way for for the push on applications to really make a lot of sense um yeah like Bas like like those two things I think you know can only really really co-evolve with each other right and like I think it's like I think it's really good that we're having all these deep discussions about like not not just how to scale in the sense of increasing TPS but like increasing TPS in the right way um and on the uh application side like it's uh well actually a lot of the same stuff right like it's uh like the thing that I hate the most is like applications that pretends to be you know crypto applications but then like the only way to sign in is a Google account and uh you know if like every it the whole thing depends on like one centralized server and there's no way to interact with it at all outside of the one server and like it basically is just a completely centralized thing that just happens to like have a couple of tokens on our or whatever somewhere or that just like happens to stick a root on ethereum once in a while right um so yeah I think like discussion about applications it's also important for that to really be principled and to sort of remember um you know like what what it is uh that we're actually all here for um so I'm a big fan of having much more highquality discourse on both of those things and like I think you can't have a healthy ecosystem without that perfect and uh but",

    "title": "Vitalik Buterin On Scaling with plasma",
    "content": "perfect and uh at the beginning of the interview you mentioned uh plasma and validium so I'd like to go back there very very quickly just for a second because earlier this week you published a Blog um and essentially I'd like you to elaborate uh why it's important uh that we rethink the fundamental limitations of uh of plasma based scaling Solutions so plasa is this interesting category of scaling solutions that got invented in 2017 when paper from Joseph punon and myself I mean realistically Joseph P did like over 80% of the work in that initial paper he deserves a lot of credit there um and uh basically it's a uh scaling design where you only need to publish a little bit of information on chain every time you have a block and then you have this mechanism called an exit game where if you have a coin inside of plasma and you want to take it out and turn it into a coin on ethereum you have to like provide pieces of the plasma tree that prove that you have that coin and then if it turns out you don't actually have that coin then whoever the real owner is can challenge and provide other pieces of the tree and put them on chain and if like you like you are in the right in the sense that like you are the one who actually has the coins then you will be able to provide the pieces of the tree to the chain that that are the evidence that you currently have that coin today and if you're not then you would not be able to do that right and there's a lot of uh cleverness in instructing these rules correctly but um once uh you do that then you basically create a system where you have a huge amount of activity happening offchain data offchain computation offchain um but what you're you are trading claims that the the two assets that can then later be uh withdrawn on the uh underlying layer one whenever you wants to right and so you can really get a lot of scalability uh benefits that way uh so plasma paper in 2017 in 2018 there was a a lot of effort going into trying to put plasma into practice and there were efforts like minimum viable plasma plasma cache plasma cach flow plasma prime a whole bunch of these uh really fascinating plasma distributions and basically they were trying to take that core idea and like turn it into something that's viable for specific use cases one of the challenges of plasma is how it is inherently more application specific than something like the evm because in the evm it's like a state machine it just like there is a function that tells you what the current uh you know what the current numbers in the database are and you just run the function and if someone else ran the function wrong then you can tell them where they ran it like you can tell the chain where they ran it they ran it wrong and that's called a fraud proof and then you can go and run a correctly again right or if it's a CK snark you just just like go and prove that you ran the computations correctly and you don't have to think about what those computations are right in a plasma system that's not how it works in a plasma system the security of the plasma system depends on the idea that you have objects that have owners and the owner of an object has the responsibility of taking that object out if they notice that something is wrong um so that's a different security model and it requires is the like applications to be designed in such a way that there aare of who the owner of particular things is at any time um and so it does require more work and it's also actually at at the beginning like not really even possible to generalize to something like the evm just because the evm just like breaks a lot of assumptions that simple Payment Systems have right like in a utxo payment system right where basically a utxo unpan transaction out but like it's like a virtual coin where if I if you pay me money then I get new coin and then if I pay you money I have to like break up one one one of my coins into two coins that are smaller and then I get back one of the coins and then you and then you get a totally new coin that contains just the money you need like the nice thing about that utxo approach is when you receive a payment you get a totally new thing none of your existing things can be changed without your consent a balance-based system right where you just like track how much money everyone has does not have that property because in a balance-based system you can change my balance without my consent by increasing it right and so like that's it feels like a really sort of obvious detail right like yes of course you could send me money without my consent and and but like we don't care because sending me money is good but uh well for me for a plasma system it's uh like that creates problems because uh suddenly it means that like the thing that I have to exit when if I wants to move my coins over to layer one is something that might be changed without even my knowledge and I might not have access to it and like what happens if if if I don't and like you have to really look through those complicated cases right what zek narks do is they massively simplify how these plasma exit games can work because they completely remove the possibility of invalid blocks the only case that you have to worry about once you have everything BK snarked is like I try to withdraw a thing but then at some point in the future someone else H um has the same thing because actually I already sent it to someone else after I exit right and this is interesting because I mean first of all it means that if you withdraw based on the latest information then your exit can be instant right you don't have to wait for other people to challenge because if you withdraw from the latest thing then like obviously there isn't any newer thing that can uh like come in and say like oh actually no like he sent the money somewhere else by no um then all of these um like complexities around how to apply it to the evm they don't entirely go away but a lot of them become much simpler and so something approaching an evm plasma actually becomes viable which I think is super interesting um so yeah and I think like just like that fact right the fact that zi Starks make everything so much easier to prove and uh like they allow you to make things be so much simpler like really reopens the design space and really creates a lot of this new ground for experimentation to be possible okay thank you very much for that explanation um certainly a lot clearer for me now",

    "content": "that's uh so that's I think the thing that I respect about it and uh actually there was this interesting news yesterday which is that YouTube announced that it's deploying basically the same algorithm um so I yeah like I definitely don't think that you know Community notes is kind of the the end of the story here right so like one other thing that I follow a lot is prediction markets uh so prediction markets basically say yeah you know you you can basically bet whether or not some particular event is going to happen and uh you know you might ask like what's the point of this like okay fine you know you can bet on things we already have sports betting but the reason why we've like a lot of intellectuals have been interested in prediction markets for a couple of decades is basically that like if you have this Market where people can bet on whether or not some event in the future will happen then like that actually lets you surface much more high quality information in terms of like people's predictions of the future right so you know you have like Trump versus Biden in the US and then um you know you have that news about you know like Trump getting convicted in that case and then there's this question you might have of like you know is this actually you know the end of Trump's case or is it basically a nothing Burg is somewhere in between and like you could actually go on the prediction markets and you could check and like his chance of winning decreased from I think it was like 54% still like about 50% um so it's uh and one of the things that I think is also good good about prediction markets is like I think they can actually solve the speed problem because uh so like with with Community notes right like the biggest criticism of them is basically that like okay they give good notes but they give good notes eventually right and by the time they give a note there's like a whole bunch of millions of people that have already seen a bunch of content and they've probably already formed their views about um you know like whether it's uh like some super contentious know like International political issue like involving a a war or a bobbing or whatever um and you know they they've already formed that view and then they just never end up seeing the correction right and with prediction markets like actually it's like well if um like some new piece of information comes along then the first person who incorporates that information and who like basically makes makes a bet based on that new information if that bet is correct like that's the person that really gets the biggest reward right and so There's an opportunity I think to like really make things that are more like prediction markets where you actually like give people incentives to try to push uh like not not just give U like correct opinions on things but actually like give correct opinions and do that and like optimize for doing that extremely quickly and like I think in 2024 I me like things like poly Market they've taken off and like like I've personally noticed that that prediction markets taken off not just in terms of like people being interested in betting on them but also in terms of like people actually pointing to them and saying like look I me know like this is what people think is the probability of something like this happening right so you know like one I mean example relevance to you might be that uh you know there's always people who say that like oh you know if like the us or Europe help Ukraine a little more then Putin is going to go launch all the nukes and therefore like no one should go and help Ukraine right and like you could actually go to these prediction Mar you could see like like what do they think is the probability that like some nuclear incident will happen and it's like some tiny number it's like 5% right actually yeah on one of them it ended up being like 7% and I thought it was high and I bet against it and uh I I think I converted like $500 into $560 that way uh but uh the yeah so it's like you know if you believe something crazy then like you know here like please bet on it right if you're not willing to bet on it like do you actually take it seriously um and uh what's interesting is that I think even Community notes itself like they've been starting to incorporate a few mechanics that are kind of a little bit prediction markety right and that they basically say that like if you uh participate in like if you make a vote on a note and then that vote ends up like you know consistently like matching the final outcome then like you get considered more more trustworthy and like your score gets counted for more right so yeah I think like basically there's this uh you know like really fascinating space of these techologies and I want to see them Thrive more and I think they can really help",

    "title": "Vitalik Buterin On Social Media",
    "content": "then on to social media I think at some point you said maybe maybe you wrote that you're leaving x/ Twitter X probably we can call it now but uh in general do you see what are the negatives and positives you see on on social media one of the ways I've heard Twitter be described is that it's the world water cooler right it's like basically this this really crazy like digital room where like all kinds of people and like including all kinds of people who really hate each other right including yourself um you know um including you know like Margarita Sim and like all of the people that you know including like people from the government of Iran including like Mega people including Communists you including liberals like everyone right and uh people who just have very incompatible perspectives and they just all you know talk basically yell at each other right and the qu the question is like you know like is this even actually productive right and there's this like Viewpoint that I think some people have where it's like oh you know like the thing that we need to bring Humanity to peace is that we just need to talk to each other more right and I think you know you've kind of seen how that's at least not true or at least like not true in like that very naive way right because uh like if you put people who hate each other distance one away from each other and like you have this you know like one big room with 100 million people shouting then uh like that's not what people's um incentive is right people like people don't just like hear the opposing side and think like that's a good argument right people like hear that opposing side and they think oh wow these people are saying like hateful things that I don't that I cannot imagine a good person saying and like look this person said this other horrible thing that's even more proof that they're horrible and like you know you actually have like even more division right and I think the the the other challenge is like when you have these very opposing groups that are focused on fighting and that that are focused on kind of constantly trying to like push their Viewpoint at the expense of other viewpoints they don't even have time to do the work of like actually trying to refine their own Viewpoint and make it better right it's like it's the same as with countries right like if you have a country that's you know like constantly trying to go off and you know like fight Wars you know it's going to end up you know like neglecting the infrastructure and Healthcare and the economy right um so that's uh like I think if we for a uh healthier internet like I actually don't think that this approach of like let's have one water cooler and let's like put the right people in charge of the water cooler is even going to work at all right I think like I definitely think there's things Wei U can do to make a water cooler better right but at the end I think like we need something that really creates space for um a lot more diversity and that like really creates um space for like these deeper conversations where you know like both within individual groups but also like communication between uh the different groups of the productive type can happen right and like that happens I think a lot that happens a lot in in the early internet era where we had forums I mean I think I know it's happening here now like it happens much more easily in long form right but like it definitely doesn't happen on a world water cooler um so I this is like one of the reasons why I'm really interested in know like supporting the alternative social media landscape right which is that uh you know we have uh all of these uh like like I want to actually uh like get to a world where we have a lot of these different social media platforms and then like they can actually like both like appeal to different groups of people but also like when you have competition between different social platforms then like like I think they actually end up competing more on the basis of quality right whereas if you have competition between people within one social media platform then they're basically just like competing to Shell louder than the other side so I want to see that um I also think that there are some uh like specific um ideas for how to improve uh social media platforms that are really worth thinking about right so like about a year ago I wrote this review of community notes right this was this uh platform that got and of added into Twitter a couple of years ago and uh like what community notes does right do it basically like lets people uh make like suggest um and ations on tweets like basically saying like you know here's some extra context or like here's one piece that's actually Incorrect and here's a source like showing what the correct thing is and if uh there's like some particular annotation that gets like wide agreement from people who often disagree with each other on other things then like that note gets shown on top of the Tweet right like I think people who have used that Twitter for a long time like they've probably seen notes before right and to me what interests me about uh notes is that like one is like it's actually doing this kind of experimentation with like new kinds of democracy right because uh like traditional democracy is kind of one person one vote right here we're not just saying Whoever has more votes can just shout louder than the other side right we're basically saying actually yeah if you can get votes from people who normally don't agree with each other then that actually Counts from more than votes from people that are all part of the same Echo chamber and look they actually tried to do this and like you know empirically it does seem to like actually uh like it seems to work actually surprisingly well for something that's like so uh like Community uh driven right and it's definitely far from perfect right and it's uh there's definitely been some good critiques that like it's not fast enough and they've tried to improve on that um but I like the thing that I respect about it is that it's uh like like it's actually trying to solve this a problem of like let's create social media that like intentionally tries to show people correct information and like show people things that would be really valuable for them to hear instead of just like showing them stuff that's like said by people who shout the loudest but it does that in a way that doesn't rely on like empowering one group of people who to kind of decide what's good and what's bad on behalf of everyone right like I think like that's the thing that people know like really hated out out of the old Twitter right and that's like basically what gave you know like El his support base right that there's this uh look there's this particular group that has these particular viewpoints and you know like I agree with a lot of them I also disagree with some of them and but at the same time it's like pushing this one perspective and like that one perspective gets reflected in who not like first of all just who gets baned who gets not banned but also in you know who gets like Shadow ban and de boosted and boosted and like all of these subtle things and uh who gets you know who gets blue check marks who doesn't right and like if like Twitter is super important social infrastructure right and like if a government was uh working in that way then like I think everyone would just say like no this is a a totally unaccountable authoritarian dictatorship I don't stand for it right and uh like what community notes said basically says is like it's actually an open source algorithm right like you can actually go run it yourself and like it's actually based on um you know like this uh like based on contributions from like people where anyone can participate in it but like at the same time it's it's like this new version of democracy that actually know like tries harder to be of favor quality in various ways right and like the thing that I did in my blog post is like I actually downloaded and I ran the source code myself and like I actually wanted verified like basically yeah what happened was that there was this community note that popped up on a site that or on a tweet that was uh basically",

    "content": "well all right uh thanks all for coming today I have the feeling vitalic doesn't need an introduction normally he's being introduced as the founder of ethereum I would like to introduce vitalic as in my mind the biggest supporter of Cipher py values in ethereum and I think that deserves an Applause I mean that being said vitalic I uh think you wrote it really night nice blog post I think it was uh the last one you wrote last year um on you know making ethereum Cipher Punk and I think that resonates very well with many people here in this room and yet as I attend some of the you know events around Defcon uh I see things that seem to be in pretty stark contrast especially to like durat nice talk you know which talked about uh all the bad things some agencies do I've seen yesterday some presentation that had in the center of it you know presenting a nice ecosystem and the center of it all in bold letters it said US banking system so at least in my mind I do see a contrast between what you describe as desirable and what some people you know I say in the defi eism specifically proposed as hyperf financialised how do you feel about that yeah I think when people saw the post like a lot of people definitely really appreciate it and people like keep referring to it even as this day and I think at the time the thing that was missing was definitely just a concrete statement of like here are some of the goals that we all value and let's like talk about what they are so that we at least have something to coordinate around in order to actually achieve them and that's step one and I feel like step one was actually done well the trickier step is step two right and step two is like getting from here to those values actually being reflected um in the world and I think it's definitely true that like crypto as a whole has you know in many ways look pretty Divergent from that and I mean there's even trends that I worry about right like even basically the fact that know originally This was meant to be this like neutral ecosystem that does not depend on governments and like there definitely now is this current of uh people who are basically explicitly saying that they defense strategy is say basically making a point that if a politician opposes them then like they'll get $20 million trying to push them out of office and like to me that is like you know not what I signed up for and uh I think you know in addition to like not being what I sign up for for the world like it's also something that uh wouldn't does not really uh imply many incentives to care about you know like things like privacy or care about things like decentralization because it's like the centralized thing has an easier time like shaking a hand with a politician and like getting it let it keep happening uh so it's uh yeah so I think there's the question of like how do we yeah actually actually go further and I think at this stage it's a big part of is it's a question of incentives right uh so the incentives basically like what is the incentive to I mean if we go even like down the list of the uh post I made a bit later on alignment right like what is the incentive to be open source what is the incentive to follow Open Standards instead of like pushing your own ERC that everyone else can't keep up with but still claiming that you're part of Team Open Standards because you have an ERC um as what is the incentive to build something that passes the walk away test when by definition if your company disappears you have no chance of getting Revenue anyway what is the incentive to make something that passes the company becomes evil test because you know yourself becoming evil is a potential Revenue opportunity what is the incentive to build something that is uh like positive some to the eorum ecosystem or to the world as a whole in a way that goes beyond what you already get with Market incentives which are sometimes sufficient and some and great and sometimes not right and I think you know ecosystem some times answers exist and sometimes they don't right so especially like if someone is making a relatively small project right if you're at the stage of making something like demo level then actually you get a lot of support right like if you have something that just requires $300,000 to make and people of the type in this room generally agree that it's like a good thing that helps make turns the ethereum ecosystem into something that better realizes its values then like there's a whole bunch of people that will give you $300,000 right and there's Ean Foundation there's probably a bunch of people who have a bunch of ideas anybody who is hacking on something or or you know thinking about something here mhm yeah okay I see a bunch of hands so where where do you send these people specifically yeah so Grant programs exist I mean one obviously you can just reach out to um ethereum Foundation ESP right so ecosystem. support that's one there's all kinds of individual like other non- ethereum Foundation entities I mean recently you know argot just spun out also the you know the big treasuries and uh you know the the Unis swaps and makers I guess now Skies um of the world uh there's uh op if you like it's retroactive but there's optimism rpgfan people there's entities like status there's entities like Golem Golem also has their own uh pgf program that's talked about less but it also exists I think octant doapp is the is is the is the site uh so there's uh like just like a lot of different even individuals that just really care about these topics right so for like smaller projects right that funding exists the place where I think it does like things become much more challenging is basically that like once you get from like demo stage to like actual serious I wants to build something that can like withstand The Winds of like mainstream ethereum use uh like right basically the level of development that you need to get to that stage is like often let's say you we'll call it like the 10 to30 million level right and I mean sometimes it's less right and but sometimes like it is that level especially for some like for something like an L2 like often gets even higher for a privacy project it's like it's often lower but it depends on general purpose infrastructure that actually took that amount of funding to get there right and the challenge is like when you go from the small side to the B size the incentive structure sort FS from like full socialist to full capitalist in of like you know the small size like you get all of these nice grants programs and you're supposed to like just do the good thing and be values aligned but then once you get to a bigger size like there's really nothing that's uh provide like at least from a raw incentives layer that's like competing with the incentive to like just grow big and like try to dominate potentially try to monopolize and like that to me is an imbalance and it feels to me like what you want is something healthy in the middle you want something where ultimately you know it's more Capital efficient than charity and you want something where incentives actually do depend on like having users and like actually you know the on the ground fact of uh whether or not you're building something that people want but then at the same time you know you want more incentives to be like to be open source to be decentralized to um like be secure and um at the same time like more incentives to take collaborative standards based approaches instead of like trying to become bigger than everyone else and like create wall Gardens and walk in and dominate the ecosystem and I think this is like definitely still one of those unsolved problems I mean speaking of the incentives here and especially on the on the funding side the question is a bit how do we get there right because you know as a funer of a privacy project I can tell you it's hard right I mean as you know but you went through it so um you know if you are contemplating the idea of building a cipher Punk values align project or you know in the next you know I'll be a bit judgy here and say reaking reaking leveraged rwa L2 lending protocol whatever you know yes you can raise a $10 million seed round and you know you can have a whole lot of fun and great side events with you know great drinks and stuff but like what do you say to the people who say no I want to go for this Cipher Punk Vision how do we make it happen like how do we yeah yeah I mean I think we definitely do need more experimentation in funding models like I think we do want something that is uh like more Capital efficient then charity so in the sense of uh you know providing money with an expectation of at least in some situations like actually getting it back and even getting a return uh but that at the same time isn't like fullon like hey please like make me a token in 12 months or else I'm going to start yelling at you and like Blacklist you from the whole Community right so which is like not too far from like the darker stuff that actually happens right uh so it's uh like I think yeah we want to like try like try to create funding structures that are somewhere in between those two and like what exactly that looks like I think that's still open to interpretation just like public goods funding is open to interpretation like you have gcoin you have optimism you have this you know like octant know Golem thing which is also actually you know like starting to look into those kinds of hybrid approaches you know you have protocol Guild and uh like the question of uh you know what are um Hybrid models that actually make sense I think it's uh really worth thinking about yeah and I mean uh so I think funding in the startup side is is one side of the world but let's talk about ethereum right so I mean ethereum is infrastructure which is used to settlement infrastructure for a bunch of defi things but also increasingly for a bunch of you know Cipher Punk things right so that are not just Financial right like enss great example right so and like a whole lot of of other things that people are settling on but yet they have to use this infrastructure which is largely influenced by decisions that are you know somewhat hyperf Financial right so if we think about you know we want credibly neutral l2s like based roll ups that you know are now maybe facing problems of you know centralized block building which is a direct consequence of hyperf financialized settlement infrastructure MH that feels still weird like what do these what do these Cipher Punk projects do like do they all just go to nosis chain and settle there or like what what do we do yeah I mean I think uh so one sorry I'm TR I had my sentence and I'm trying to restart it again um the uh yeah so okay so what you don't want I think is you don't want to like lean too hard on like badgering everyone to like do the to to do the aligned thing right because like if you try to Badger everyone to be virtuous then like eventually you start getting a community of people that are just like too fed up with it and they start doing their own thing and then eventually they like get all the way up to 51% and then like the the community swings in the other direction and you lose completely right um and so I think like you want we want some kind of realistic strategy and ideally a realistic strategy that depends on a smaller number of actors so I'll give one example of something that I'm happy about one thing that I'm happy about is recently I think we've been seeing a shift in Market structure of how L2 is work where there's growing separation between the technology providers and sort of the front- facing L2 teams right so examples of this include one nether mes announcing surge right where like a big part of the intent is like they don't want to necessarily play and like win the rollup game themselves it's just like creating software and if other people use it then great um two the Paradigm you know like wrath and Etha efforts three within the optimism ecosystem you know like optimism itself is a serious software house and then a lot of the l3s and like other things in the super chain end up by using that same technology um for you know succinct as like Z proving people like there there's this growing list of these uh providers and then separately you have these l2s and l2s are starting to specialize more and like basically everything but the tech and like actually reaching out to users and making the like the thing mainstream right and like this is not a full separation right but I think it's like partially happening and the reason why I think it's a good thing is because that basically means that like the tech decisions get made by people who have the expertise to and often already have the willingness and enthusiasm to make the technical decisions in the right way right like if Sony had to make a layer two from scratch and they had to write every line of code from scratch then the chance that they would ever even add something like a um you know an L1 censorship resistance bypass channel it's like lower right but I you know they're working with the op stack and like this is a team that actually really cares about a lot of those things and basically use the infrastructure that has a like more value as we care about like really baked in right and like this so a lot more things that like basically happen by default right and I think like that's one example of the yet answers that's happening right I think uh like I'm definitely not one of these me know like market maximalists like dollars optimize the economy by themselves people right but at the same time I do think that you know the value like of uh idealistic motives and uh like enthusiasm and ideas Ando and stories and all these things really important right and I think there's lots of examples of this in the wild right like one fun fact about the world is that the total annual revenue of open AI plus all of its competitors is this year is less than only fans right but even still right if you think about like the level of talent that's going into only fans like it's not low there's serious people there but if you think about the the you know if you think about the level of talent that's going into like things um like making all of these crazy AIS that's like a whole other level right and like that extra level of motivation like that's not the dollars right but and so I think the ideal solution is one that you know like it does it is something that is realistic from in like from a dollar perspective and actually gives those incentives but then at the same time like it doesn't like require the whole world to be converted to the religion but if there are if there is a small group of enthusiasts that are also like talented people then like you should be able to take maximum advantage of that and I think we are starting to see some signs of that okay cool so I guess that means that if I am working on you know some more Cipher Punky thing at least I can leverage the same technology which you know the nice people build and which is also used by all the you know highly financialized use cases but I get the upsides of it as well exactly okay cool well um let let's come back from the layer two to the to the layer one right because one cyer thing that people like is obviously home staking right anyone hear home staking on any chain yes I see a bunch of hands cool awesome now um these home stakers are sometimes looking at the big guys right so the professional stakers and you know are thinking well what do they actually add to the security of ethereum really right so let's say I add one e to binance binance is staking it on you know some servers that are managed by let's say a cloud provider the cloud provider has like a you know service provider who happens to be their devops guy who manages their servers what exactly does that add to the security of ethereum you know versus maybe fewer e that are being staked by home stakers yeah I I agree with this I mean there's two ways to measure St like security provided by staking right one way is like number of dollars to make a 51% attack right and so the theory is that well if bu ever actually does 51% attack ethereum then even if they succeed then they're going to lose like billions of dollars that will get burned in either slashing or an inactivity leak following a minority softwork right and but then that's one argument but then from that perspective like arguably we have way too much security right now right because what we have now is like 30 million e staking you need a third of it to do an Attack under any realistic conditions you actually need somewhere between one half and twoth thirds and so let's say 15 million eth multiply that by I think the price is like up to 3,200 now and so we're talking 48 billion do right there are lots of ways to like whack ethereum dead for less than $48 billion right and so it's like well if instead we you know like loosen up a bit on that $48 billion number like $4.8 billion is plenty right and then if we at the same time put extra work in protecting the peer-to-peer layer making sure that there aren't any serious bugs improving every other dimension of robustness improving the social layer on net ethereum would be much more secure right now so what's the other perspective of security it's like basically how much independent entropy are you contributing to this like function that is uh choosing the next block right and if you're just putting your coins into the biggest thing then like you're basically contributing no entropy right if you're a solo Staker then you're contributing a lot of entropy and the challenge uh basically is that like the protocol does not have good ways of like detecting what independent entropy is you can try right so earlier this year Tony varer and I published a series of posts and like analyses talking about this concept of anti-correlation penalties that basically try to penalize a validator more if they like do fail and like do bad things at the same like even just like go offline at the same time as many other validators doing the same thing in a way that like actually works fairly frequently and our analysis suggests that could reduce the uh uh the disparity between solo stakers and like the best of the best stakers with the best infra by a factor of about two right so like it could be a gain right but at the same time it's like well binance can afford really huge infrastructure and actually in the normal case they're actually like pretty reliable in terms of being always online right and it's like the situations that you're worried about are actually situations that just take a long long time to ever actually happen right and so I think part of the answer inevitably has to be not economic like part of the answer definitely has to be like staking as a hobby staking as a social thing staking as a thing where there's extra protocol ways to try to identify who actually is providing this uh independent entropy and potentially rewarding them in extra protocol ways um St potentially it involves like trying to combine staking together with other services and like make it easier for people to like basically potentially have a box that you know dust staking is a decentralized VPN exit nodes has the Llama 405b running on it just like have do all the cipher buuny things that like at the same time all for the price of one like a lot there's like a lot of extra protocol things that I think are really worth looking into as well and like you know you try to like make it into a hobby and not just talk about it as a money-making opportunity um so I think you like inevitably you will have to lean on that though at the same time we also have to improve the omics to the point where at least there isn't a large disincentive to join and like be part of the big pools right and uh I think we can do that with a combination of like one possibly the anticorrelation work but then two just massively reducing the software and the hardware barrier to entry to being a Staker which stateless clients uh po like Z snarking the chain like basically the whole Verge road map does as well and so I think and also you know reducing the 32 eth minimum that like that in the in the long-term merge road map so all of these things together I think like give us the best fighting chance we can have so it seems like vitalic says nerds and not exchanges secur e theorem I think that resonates with a bunch of people here um now if I if I hear you say that okay we should make that easier and and lower the requirements also that seems to be at odds with some things I hear in the ecosystem of saying let's increase the block gas limit right because so my anecdote is well I live in an unfortunate place on the planet where I have you slow up link and there are limits right so yes so yes okay so where do you draw them like who do you want to exclude like should I not validate blocks on ethereum because I have you know so so the long term here is the best of both worlds right the long term here is that you get the best of like basically you use Technologies like statelessness you use ZK proving and so on to be able to get the benefits of larger blocks but at the same time much lower verification cost other interesting Technologies are ways to try to like separate out the authority of of of like staking participants right so if for example for me reasons block production is inherently this like centralizing game that gets won by people with the best hftt connections and like binance accounts and everything then at the very least you like separate out the authority of making inclusion list like selecting transactions that have to get included or you potentially separate out like the top of block and the middle of block and you try to like at least like decentralize as many of those authorities that are enough to make sure that the ethereum chain fulfills the guarantees that it needs to fulfill so I think those are the two techniques all right nice so that was probably like a a lot of like maybe technical uh details but there's also a hackaton coming up on the weekend and I would like to hear from you vitalic like what is on your wish list maybe some ideas of like Cipher Punk things that maybe some people here in the room want to hack on next weekend and still have a week to get up to speed on by the way mhm yeah so One Direction that I think people don't talk about enough actually we'll have a little bit of people of talking about this at diak day and at defon uh but basically I think uh one like shift that valuable for like The Cypher Punk movements to make I think is like 30 years ago it was uh conceived as this thing that's like fully oppositional to know governments corporations like all kinds of existing actors and I think uh one thing that we can do is I think if we want to improve the the the movement's chance of succeeding and making an impact like identify the situations where there actually are points of alignment with a lot of people even within like some of these uh mainstream institutions and uh like basically try to like front run the you know like the nasty ways of solving those uh those problems as so eloquently talked about with better ways of solving those problems and like one specific example I can give um is uh if you have an encrypted messenger you can use locally running llms to do scam detection right like you can potentially have a system where like a user can even download llms that from an entire like set of different different providers with different biases biases different goals and like they could automatically you know like scan through stuff that's uh happening could be messaging this could also even be part of your crypto wallet right a lot of ethereum wallets like have some level this detection already and then if something is uh popping up that looks like it's a scam then like it can warn you right and this is something that runs fully on device and ideally you have a choice of different providers and so you do it doesn't like entrench one particular political Elite who decides what right what's right and what's wrong ideally you have uh and it stays all on your device not shipping any data whatsoever to big brother and and uh like and then ideally at the operating system level like you can actually like sandbox this whole thing so that's all that it can do and it actually can't like later on download an update that starts pushing this stuff up to Big Brother right and then you know you you solve like real safety problems that lots of people including lots of us have and that also like lots of people within governments have and like actually like basically do a better job of solving problems that people have than even the centralized world can um I mean also uh shout out there's this interesting app in Taiwan called message Checker I see you know like Audrey there's and also a fan of it so I think like Proto versions of things like this uh already exist but I think it's a direction that could be explored more cool as a last any like we obviously don't mention ticker symbol but um any shout out to you know Cypher Punk and privacy apps I seen that you you know like you know to talk about actually you know value aligned l2s like fuel or mention projects uh you know like fers like any okay a quick list uh so privacy on the Privacy for like privacy for coins uh so realway um also Oxbo which is is coming out soon and like that has like also a lot of uh good uh like proof of uh the Privacy pools technology so I use Railway right now and you know also excited about Oxo um on the uh I mean privacy preserving messaging it's like there's a lot right it's like you know like status keeps quiet improving and then there is I know like Simplex is like getting exciting exciting there's like a lot of these different chats um DX um AKA file verse for privacy preserving documents it's like actually quite good secure operating system graphos I use it it's amazing it's like surprisingly few user experience trade-offs uh so I think it's great and then also ethos which is a based off of graphos and like they also recently released a hardware device um so yeah and a lot of really good stuff awesome that sounds fantastic thank you vitalic for supporting Cipher Punk values",

    "content": "the very Basics what is the blockchain or perhaps we might even start at the uh the Byzantine General's problem and Byzantine fall tolerance in general that I I uh Bitcoin was taking steps to uh providing a solution for so the Byzantine General's problem is this uh paper that Leslie Lamport published in 1982 where he has a St experim M where if you have two generals that are of camped out on opposite sides of a city um and they're planning when to attack the city then uh the question is and if how could those generals coordinate with each other and they could send me Messengers between each other but those Messengers kind of could get sniped by the enemy on the road road uh some of those messages could end up being traitors and if things could end up happening and with just two uh mess uh generals it turns out that there's kind of no solution in a finite number of rounds that guarantees that they will be able to of coordinate on the same answer um but then in the case where you have more than two generals then Les analyzes cases like um are the mess messages kind of just oral messages um are the messages kind of signed messages so I could give you a me a signed message and then you can pass along that signed message and the third party can still verify that I originally made that message and depending on those different cases there's kind of different bounds on like given how many generals and how many Traders among those generals and what like under what conditions you actually can agree when to launch an attack uh so it's actually a big misconception that the the Byzantine General's problem was unsolved so let solved it the thing that was unsolved though is that all of these Solutions assume that you've already agreed on of a fixed list of who the generals are and these generals have to be kind of semi-trusted to some extent they can't just be anonymous people because if they're Anonymous then like the enemy could just be 99% of the generals uh so right the um in the 1980s and the 1990s kind of the general use case for distributed system stuff was more kind of enterpris stuff where you could kind of assume that you know you know who the nodes are that are running these kind of computer networks so if he wants to have some of decentralized computer network that pretends to be a single computer and that you can kind of do do of operations on then it's made out of these of 15 specific computers and we know kind of who and where they are and so we have a good reason to believe that say at least 11 of them would be fine and it it could also be within a a single system almost like almost a network of devices sensors so on like an airplanes and I think uh like flight systems in general still use these kinds of ideas yep yep um so so that's the 80s that's the 80s and 90s now the cipher punks had a different use case in mind which is that they wanted to create a fully decentralized Global prision was currency and the problem here is that they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want any kind of privileged list of people and so now the question is well how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of measuring identities right you have no way of kind of determining whether or not some 99% of participants aren't actually all the same guy and so the clever solution that Satoshi had this is uh kind of going back to the that presentation I made at Defcon a few months ago where said that the things Satoshi invented with crypto economics um is this uh really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind of limit ident how many identities you can get and the uh if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency then the only way to do this is with proof of work right so with proof of work the solution is just uh you um publish a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle that takes some uh kind of clearly calculable amount of computational power to solve you get an identity and then you solve five of those puzzles you get five identities and then these are the identities that we run the consensus algorithm between so the proof of work mechanism you just described is like the fundamental idea proposed in the in the white paper that defines Bitcoin uh what's the idea of consent that we wish to reach what why is consensus important here what is consensus so the goal here in just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wire together a set of a large number of computers in such a way that they kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single computer where that single computer keeps working even if a large portion of the kind of constituents the computers that make it up break and kind of break in arbitrary ways like they could shut off they could try to actively break a system they could do lots of mean things so the um reason why the cipher punks wanted to do this is because they wanted to run one particular program on this virtual computer and the one particular program that they wanted to run is just a currency system right it's a system that just processes a series of transactions and for every transaction it verifies uh that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction it verifies that the digital signature is correct and if the check's passed then it subtracts the coins from one account and adds the coins to the other account roughly so first of all the the the proof of work idea is kind of I mean at least to me seems pretty fascinating it is I mean that's a it's kind of a revolutionary idea I mean is is it is it obvious to come up with that you can use uh you can exchange basically computation resources for for identity mhm it's uh it actually has a pretty long history it was uh first proposed in a paper by m cythia dwar and neor in 1994 I believe and the original use case was combating email spam uh so the idea is that if you send an email you have to send it with a proof of work attached and like this makes it reasonably cheap to send emails to your friends but it makes it really expensive to send spam to ion people yeah that's a simple brilliant idea so maybe also taking a step back so what is the role of blockchain in this what is the blockchain sure so the blockchain my way of thinking about it is that it is this uh kind of system where you have this kind of one virtual computer created by just a bunch of these uh nodes in the network um and the reason why the term blockchain is used is because the data structure that these systems use at least so far is one where they um of different nodes in the network periodically publish blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions uh together with a pointer like a hash of a pre a previous block that it builds on top of um and so you have series of blocks that that nodes in the network create where each block points to the previous Block it's so you have this chain of them is a fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of blockchain or is there a lot of possibilities different ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on there are indeed a lot of possibilities um so in a kind of just simple architecture as I just described the way the fault tolerance happens is like this right so you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily kind of occasionally creating blocks building on top of each other's blocks and let's say you have kind of one block we'll call it kind of block one um and then someone else builds another block honestly we'll call it block two then we have an attacker and what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries to revert block two and the way the revert block two is instead of doing the thing they're supposed to do which is build a block on top of block two they're going to build another block on top of block one um so you have block one which has two children block two and then block two prime now this might sometimes even happen by random chance if you know two nodes in the network just happen to create blocks at the same time and then it would hear about each other's things before they create their own but this also could happen because of an attack now if this happens you have an attack then the no in the Bitcoin system the nodes follow the longest chin um so if um this um attack had happened when the original chain had more than two blocks on it so if it was trying to kind of revert more than more than two blocks then everyone would just would just ignore it um and everyone would just keep following the regular chain but here you know we have block two and we have block two Prime and so the two are kind of even and then whatever block um the next block is created on top of so say block three is now created on top of block two prime then everyone say agrees that block three is the new head um and block two prime is just kind of Forgotten and then everyone just kind of peacefully Builds on top of block three and then thing continues so how difficult is it to mess with the system I so how like if we look at the general problem like how many what fraction of people who participate in the system have to be bad players in order to mess with it truly like what's your is there is there a good number the is um well depending on kind of what your model of the participants is and like what kind of attack we're talking talking about it's anywhere between 23.2 and 50% of what of all of the computing power in the network sorry so 22 and 23 between 23.2 and 50% and 50% are can be uh compromised so like once your once your P your portion of the total um computing power in the network goes above the 23.2 level then there's and if things that you could mean things that you can potentially do and as your percentage of the network kind of keeps going up then the your ability to do mean things kind of goes higher and then if you have above 50% then you can just break everything so H how hard is it to achieve that level like it seems that so far historically speaking it's been exceptionally difficult but so this is a challenging question um so the economic cost of uh acquiring that level of stuff from scratch is uh fairly High I think it's uh somewhere in the low billions of dollars and when you say that stuff you mean computational resources yeah so specifically specialized hardware and of as6 that people use to solve these puzzles to do the mining these small small tangent uh so obviously I work a lot in deep learning with gpus and ASX for that application and I tangentially kind of hear that so many of these you know sometimes Nvidia gpus are sold out uh because of this other application like what do if you can comment I don't know if you're familiar or interested in the space what kind of as6 what kind of Hardware is generally used these days for to do the actual computation for the the proof of work sure so in the case of Bitcoin and ethereum are a bit different so in the case of Bitcoin there is an algorithm called the shot 256 it's just a hash function and so the puzzle is just coming up with a number where the hash of the number is below some threshold and so because the hashes are designed to be random you just have to keep on trying different numbers until one works and the as6 are just like specialized circuits that contain and circuits for evaluating this hash over and over again and you have like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacked on top of each other inside of a box and you just keep on running the Box 247 in the as6 there's literally specialized Hardware designed for this yes oh this is we live in an amazing world another tangent and I'll come back to the basics but uh does Quantum Computing throw a rench into any of this very good question so quantum computers have two main of families of algorithms that are relevant to cryptography one is a shor's algorithm and Shores algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks the hardness of some specific kinds of mathematical problems so the one that you've probably heard of is it makes it very easy to factor numbers uh so figure out kind of what prime factors are that kind of that you need to multiply together to get some number even if that number is extremely big um shes algorithm can also be used to break elliptic curve cryptography um it can break like any kind of hit and Order groups so it it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic nice things that we're used to but the good news is that for every of major use of things that chores algorithm breaks we already know of quantum proof Alternatives right now the we don't use these Quantum proof Alternatives yet because in many cases they're five to 10 times less efficient but and the crypto industry in general kind of knows that this is coming eventually and it's s of ready to take the H and switch to that stuff when we when we have to the second algorithm that is relevant to cryptography is Grover's algorithm and and Grover's algorithm might even be of more familiar to AI people that's basically usually described as solving search problems um but the idea here is that if you have a problem over the form find a number that satisfies some property um then if with a classical computer you need to try kind of end times before before you find a number then with a quantum computer you only need to do square root of n computation M and Grover could potentially be used for mining but there's two possibilities here one is that Grovers could be used for mining and whoever creates the first working qu computer that could do Grovers will just mine way faster than everyone else and we'll see another round of uh what we saw when A6 came out which is the kind of the new hardw just kind of dominated the old stuff and then eventually it switched to a new equilibrium but by the way way FAS F not exponentially faster quadratically faster quadratically faster which is not sort of uh it's not gamechanging I would say it's or like asex like you said it would be exactly yeah so it would not necessarily break proof of work as of things that's right yeah now the other kind of possible world right is that quantum computers have a lot of overhead there's a lot of an a complexity involved in maintaining Quantum States and there's also as we've been realizing recently like making quat of computers actually work requires of quatum mirror correction which requires kind of a thousand real cubits per logical cubid and so there's the very real possibility that the overhead of running a quantum computer will be higher than the speed up you get with Grovers which would be kind of sad but which would also mean that like given proof of work would just keep working fine so beautifully put so so proof of work is the core idea of Bitcoin is there other core ideas before would kind of take a step towards the origin story and ideas of ethereum is there other stuff that were key to the white paper of Bitcoin there's proof of work and then there's just the cryptography just kind of public keys and signatures that are used to uh verify transactions those two are the big things so then what is um the origin story maybe the human side but also the technical side of a theum sure so I joined the Bitcoin community in 2011 and I started by just writing I first wrote for this s of online thing called Bitcoin weekly then I started writing for Bitcoin magazine and uh sorry to interrupt you have this funny kind of uh story true or not is uh that you were disillusioned by the downsides of centralized control from your experience with W World of Warcraft is is this true or you're just being witty uh I mean the event is true the fact that that's the reason I do decentralization is witty maybe just a small tangent do have you always had a skepticism of centralized control is that to some degree yeah has that feeling evolved over time or is that just always been a core feeling that decentralized control is the future of a human society and it's definitely been something that felt very attractive to me ever since I could have learned that such a thing isoss it's possible even technically so great so you were you joined the Bitcoin community in 2011 you said you began writing MH so what's next started writing uh moved from high school to University halfway in between that and spent a year in University um then at the end of that year I dropped out to to do Bitcoin things full-time and this was a combination of continuing to write Bitcoin magazine but also increasingly work on software projects and I traveled around the world for about six months and just going to different Bitcoin communities like I went to First in New Hampshire then Spain other European places Israel and then San Francisco and along the way and I've met a lot of other people that are working on different Bitcoin projects and when I was in Israel there were some kind of very smart teams there that were working on ideas that people were starting to kind of call Bitcoin 2.0 so one of these was colored coins which is basically saying that hey let's uh not just use the blockchain for Bitcoin but let's also kind of issue other kinds of assets on it and then there was a protocol called Master coin that supported issuing assets but also supported many other things like Financial contracts like domain name registration and a lot of different things together and I spent some time working with these teams and I quickly kind of realized that this Master coin protocol could be improved by kind of generalizing it more right so the master the analogy I use is that the master coin protocol was like the SSS army knife you have 25 different transaction types for 25 different applications but what I realized is that you could replace a b a bunch of them with things that are more general purpose so one of them was that you could replace like three transaction types for three types of financial contracts with a generic transaction type for a financial cont ract that just let you specify a mathematical formula for kind of who how much money each side Gets By the way a small pause what's you say Financial contract just the terminology what is a contract um what's a financial contract so the this is just generally an agreement where kind of either one or two parties kind of put collateral kind of in um and then the depending on kind of certain conditions like this could involve prices of assets this could involve different um the actions of the two parties could involve other things um they kind of get of different amounts of of assets out that have just depend on things that happened so a contract is really a financial contract is is at the core it's the it's the core interactive element of a financial system yeah there's yeah there's many different kinds of financial contracts like there's things like options where you kind of give someone the right to buy a thing that you have for some specific price for some period of time there's a contracts for difference where you basically are kind of making a bet that says like for every dollar this thing goes up I'll give you $7 or for every dollar the thing goes down you give me $7 or something like that and but the main idea that these contracts have to be enforced and trusted yes exactly you have to trust that they will work out in a system where nobody can be trusted yes this is such a beautiful complicated system okay so uh so you were seeking to kind of generalize this basic uh framework of contracts mhm uh so what does that entail so what what technically are the steps to creating ethereum sure so I guess just to kind of continue a bit with this master coin story um so started by kind of giving ideas for how to generalize the thing and eventually um this turned into a much more kind of fully-fledged proposal just says hey how about you scrap all your features and instead you just um put in this programming language and I gave this idea to them and their response was something like hey this is great but this seems complicated and this seems like something that's we're not going to be able to put onto our road map for a while and my response to this was like wait do you not realize how revolutionary this is well I'll just go do it myself and then I what was the name of the programming language I just called it ultimate scripting great uh so then I uh kind of went through a couple more rounds of iteration and then the idea for ethereum itself started to form um and the idea here is that you just have a blockchain where the core unit of the thing is what we call contracts it's these kind of accounts that can hold assets um and that they have their own internal memory but that are controlled by a piece of code and so if I send some ether to a contract the only thing that can determine where that kind of ether the currency inside etherium and of goes after that um is the code of that contract itself and so basically you kind of sending assets to computer programs becomes this s of Paradigm for creating these of agree self-executing agreements self-executing it's so cool that code is sort of part of this contract mhm so that that's what's meant by smart contracts yeah so how hard was it to build this kind of thing harder than expected um and originally I actually thought that this would be a thing that I would kind of casually work on for a couple of months publish and then go back to University M um then I released it and a bunch of people or I released a white paper white paper the idea is there the idea the white paper um a whole bunch of people came in offering to help a huge number of people of expressed interest and this was something I was totally not expecting and then I kind of realized that this would be something that's kind of much bigger than I had ever thought that it would be and then we started on this kind of much longer development log of making something that lives up to this s of much higher level of expectations what are the some of the is it fundamentally like software engineering challenges there social okay so there's and social so so what are the biggest interesting challenges that you've learned about human civilization and and software engineering through this process so I guess one of the challenges for me is that like I'm one of the kind of apparently unusual geek school and have never treated with anything but kindness in school yes um and so when I uh got into crypto I kind of expected everyone would just kind of be the same kind of altruistic and nice in that same way um but the um the algorithm that I used for finding co-founders for this thing was not very good it was of literally what computer scientists called the greedy algorithm It's s of the first 15 people C applied back offering to help kind of are the co-founders Oh you mean like literally the the the people that for will form to be the the the the founders co-founders of the community the algorithm I like how you call it the algorithm yeah um and so what happened was that uh these um like especially as the project got really big like there started to be a lot of this kind of infighting and there were a lot of like I wanted the thing to be a nonprofit and some of them wanted to be a for-profit um and then there started to be people who were just kind of totally unable to work with each other there were people that were kind of trying to get an advantage for themselves in a lot of different ways and this uh just about 6 months later led to this big governance crisis and then we kind of reshuffled leadership a bit and then uh the project kept on going then nine months later there was another governance crisis and then there was a third governance crisis and so is there a way to If you're looking at The Human Side of Things is there a way to optimize this aspect of the cryptocurrency world it seems that there is is um from my perspective there's a lot of different characters and personalities and Egos and like you said uh I don't know if you know I also like just think that most of the world most of the people in the world are well intentioned but the way those intentions are realized May perhaps come off as uh yeah as as negative like what uh is there is there a hopeful message here about creating a governance structure for cryptocurrency that uh where everyone gets along and after about four rounds of reshuffling I think we've actually come up with something that seems to be pretty stable and happy um I think uh I mean I definitely do think that you most people are well intentioned I just think that like one of the reasons why like decentralization is just because there's like this thing about power where power attracts people with ego and so that just allows a very small percentage of people to just ruin so many things you think ego has a you think ego has a use like is ego always bad it seems like sometimes does but in the ethereum research team I feel like we've found also kind of a lot a lot of very good people that are just kind of primarily just interested in things for the technology and uh know things seem to just generally be going quite well yeah when you're when the focus and the passions in the tech so on so that's the human side of things but the technology side like what have you learned what what have been the biggest challenges of bringing ethereum to life on the technology side so I think first of all just uh you know there's like the first law of software development which is that when someone gives you a timetable I'm switch the unit of time to the next largest just unit of time and add one and like we basically fell victim to that um and and so instead of taking like 3 months it ended up taking like 20 months to watch the thing um that was just I think underestimating the Sher technical complexity of the thing um there are research challenges like so for example one of the things that we've been saying from the start that we would do one is a switch from a proof of work to a proof of stake um where proof of stake is this alternative consensus mechanism where instead of having to waste a lot of computing power on solving these mathematical puzzles that don't mean anything you kind of prove that you have access to coins inside of the system and this uh and of gives you some level of participation in the consensus can you maybe elaborate on that a little bit I understand the idea of proof of work um I know that a lot of people say that the idea of proof of stake is really appealing can you maybe on in a longer explain what it is sure uh so basically the idea is like if I kind of lock up 100 coins then I turn that into a kind of quote virtual minor and the system itself kind of automatically of randomly assigns that in a virtual minor the right to create blocks at particular intervals and then if someone else has 200 coins and they walk walk those 200 coins then they get a kind of twice as big virtual minor they'll be able to create blocks twice as often right so it tries to kind of do similar things to proof of work except instead of the thing and of rate limiting your participation being your ability to crank out solutions to kind of hash challenges the thing that reates your participation is kind of how much coins you're of locking into this mechanism okay so interesting so that that limited participation doesn't require you to run a lot of compute mhm uh does that mean that the Richer you areh so rich people um are more like their identity is more right and this stable yeah verifiable or whatever whatever the right terminology is right and this is definitely a copid critique I think my usual answer to this is that like proof of work is even more of that kind of yes exactly I didn't mean it in that statement as a criticism I think you're exactly right that's equivalent the proof of work is the same kind of thing but in the proof of work you have to also use physical resources yes and uh burn computers and burn trees and all of that stuff is there um a way to mess with the system over the proof of U proof of stake there is but you once again need to have a very large portion of all the coins that are locked in the system to do anything bad got it so yeah and just to that maybe take a small tangent one of the criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact uh that I guess for the proof of work mechanism you have to use so much energy in the world yes is one of the motivations of proof of stake is to move away from this definitely like what's your sense of the uh maybe I'm just underinvested Bitcoin consum as much energy as the country of Austria or something like that yeah and then ethereum is like right now maybe only like half an order of magnitude smaller than Bitcoin I've heard you talk about ethereum 2.0 so what's the what's the dream of ethereum 2.0 what's the the status of proof of stake as the mechanism that ethereum moves towards and also how do you move to a different mechanism of consensus with within a cryptocurrency so ethereum .0 is a collection of major upgrades that we've wanted to do to ethereum for quite some time the two big ones uh one is proof of stake and the other is what we call sharding um sharding solves another problem with blockchains which is scalability and what charting does is it basically says instead of every participant in the network having to personally download and verify every transaction every participant in the network only downloads and verifies a small portion of transactions and you kind of randomly distribute who gets how much work um and because the of how the distribution is random it still has the property that you need a large portion of the entire network to corrupt what's going on inside of any Shard but the system is still in a very redundant and very secure that's brilliant how how hard is that to implement and how hard is uh proof of stake to implement like on the technical level yeah software level proof of stake and charting are both challenging um I'd say sharting is a bit more challenging the reason is that proof of stake is kind of just a change to the how the consensus layer Works charting does both that but it's also a change to the networking layer um the reason is that charting is kind of pointless if at the networking layer you still do what you do today which is you kind of Gossip everything which means that if someone publishes something every other node and the client hears it like from uh on the networking layer and so instead we have to have an sub networks and the ability to quickly switch between sub networks and have the sub networks talk to each other and this is all doable but it's a uh more complex architecture and it's definitely the sort of thing that has not yet been done in cryptocurrency so most most of the networking layer in uh cryptocurrency is you're shouting you're like broadcasting messages and this is more like a hoc networks like yeah you're shouting within smaller groups smaller group but you have like a bunch of sub like exactly and you have to switch between oh man I'd love to see the so it's a beautiful idea uh so from a graph theoretic perspective but just the software of that like who's responsible is the ethereum project like the people involved would they be implementing like what's the actual you know this is like legit software engineering uh who like how does that work how do people collaborate build that kind of project is this like almost um like is there a a a soft engineering lead is there m is like is it a legit almost like large scale open source project there is yeah so um we have someone named Danny Ryan on our team who's just been brilliant and great all around and he is a kind of day facto kind of development coordinator I guess it's like you have to invent job titles for this stuff right the reason is that um like we also have this Unique Kind of organizational structure where the Ean Foundation itself kind of does search in house but then the actual implementation is done by independent teams that are separate companies and they're located all around the world and like fun places like Australia um and so you know you can kind of just need a bunch of of almost non-stop cat hurting to just keep getting these people to of talk to each other and kind of implement this spec make sure that everyone agrees on of what what's going on and kind of how to interpret different things so how far into the future are we from these two mechanisms in ethereum 2.0 like what's what's your sense of the timeline keeping in mind the previous comment you made about the sort of uh General curse of software projects so ethereum 2.0 is split into three phases so phase zero just creates a proof stake Network and it's actually separate from kind of proof of uh the proof of work Network at the beginning just to kind of give it time to grow and improve itself do people get to choose sorry to interrupt do people get to choose I guess which they get to choose to move over if they want to then phase one adds sharding but it only adds sharding of of data storage and not sharding of computation and then after that there is of the merger phase which is where the uh if the accounts kind of smart contracts like all of the of activity on the existing eth1 system just kind of gets cut and pasted into eth2 and then the proof of work chain gets forgotten and then and things all the things that were living there before just kind of continue living inside of the pro of steak system so for timelines um phase zero has been uh kind of almost fully implemented um and now it's just a matter of uh a whole bunch of security auditing and testing um my own experience is that right now it feels like we're at about a phase comparable to when we were doing uh the original ethereum launch when we were maybe about four months away from launch but that's just a hunch then that's just a that's just a hunch yeah so how you know it took it took like o over a decade for people to move from python 2 to Python 3 uh how do you see the move from like this phase zero of for for different consensus mechanism do you see there being a a drastic phase shift in people just kind of jumping to this better mechanism so in Phase zero I don't expect too many people to do much because in Phase zero and phase one the new chain you if deliberately if doesn't have too much functionality turn on it's there just like if you want to be a proof of stake validator you can get things started if you want to store data for like other blockchain applications you can get started but existing applications will largely keep living on each one and then when the merger happens then the merger is a operation that happens all at once so that's kind of one of the benefits of a canens A system that like on the one hand you have to coordinate the upgrade but on the other hand the upgrade can be coordinated so what's Casper FFG by the way um Casper FFG is the consensus algorithm that we are using for the proof of stake is there something interesting uh specific about Casper FFG like some beautiful aspect of it that's uh there is so Casper FFG combines together kind of two different schools of K algorithm design so the general two different schools of the of this design are right one is uh 50% fault tolerant but dependent on network synchrony so 50% fault to fault tolerant but it tolerate up to 50% of faults but not more but it depends on an assumption that all of the can talk talk to each other within some of limited period of time like if I send a message you'll receive it within a few seconds um and the second school is 33% fa tolerant but safe under asynchron which means that like if we agree on something then that thing is finalized and even if the network goes horribly wonky a second after that thing is finalized there's no way to revert that thing um and that's fascinating how you would make that happen it's uh definitely quite clever um I'd recommends the Casper FFG paper um if you just search like archive as in like ARX I and Casper FFG it's that's an archive the paper's on archive yeah yeah who are the authors um myself and Virgil Griffith that's awesome I take a small tangent this idea of just putting out white papers and papers and putting them on archive and just putting them publicly is that is that at the core is that a necessary component of cryptocurrency is that the tradition started with uh uh Satoshi nakam what what do you make of it like what do you make of the future of that kind of sharing of ideas I guess so yeah and it's definitely something that's like kind of mandatory for crypto because like crypto is all about making systems where you know you don't have to trust The Operators to trust that the thing works and so if like anything behind how a system works is close source to and that kind of kills the point and so there is the kind of a sense in which the fundamental properties of the category of the thing we're trying to build just kind of forces openness but also openness just has proven to be a really great way to collaborate and then there's actually been a lot of kind of innovation and academic collaboration that's just kind of happened ad hoc in the crypto space the last few years so like for example we have this forum called e research that's like eth e a r and then C um and there we publish kind of just ideas in a form that's kind of half formal like it's halfway in between like it's it's a kind of a text write up and then you can have math in it but it's often of much shorter than a paper and mo it turns out that the great majority of new ideas like they're just kind of fairly small nuggets that you can explain in like 5 to 10 lines and they don't really they don't need the whole formality of a paper exactly they don't require the kind of like 10 pages of and a filler and so introduction conclusion is not needed yeah and so instead you just kind of publish the idea and then people can go comment on it and Brilliant yeah this has been great for us I think I interrupted you was there something else on Casper FFG that's no so just Casper FFG is just kind of combines together these two schools um and so basically it creates this system where if you have more than 50% that are honest then um and you have Network synchrony then the thing kind of goes as a chain but then if Network synchrony fails then kind of the last few blocks in the chain might um kind get replaced but anything that was finalized by this of more asynchronous process uh gets uh like can't be reverted and so you essentially get a kind of best of Both Worlds between those two models okay so I know what I'm doing tonight I'm going to be reading the cas Refuge paper uh apologize for the romanticized question but what to you are some or the most beautiful idea in the world of ethereum just something uh surprising Something Beautiful Something powerful yeah I mean I think the fact that money can just emerge out of a database if enough people believe in it I think is definitely one of those things that's up there there um I think one of the things that I really love about ethereum is also this concept of composability so this is the idea that like if I build an application on top of ethereum then you can build an application that talks to my application and you don't even need my permission you you don't even need to talk to me right so one really fun example of this is there was this and of game on ethereum called crypto kitties that just involve kind of breeding digital cats yes and someone else created a game called crypto dragons where the way you play crypto dragons is you have a dragon and you have to feed it crypto kitties and they just uh created the whole thing just like as an ethereum contract that you would send these uh these tokens that are defined by this other ethereum contract and for the interoperability to happen like the projects didn't don't really need to like the teams don't really need to talk to each other you just kind of interface with the existing program so it's arbitrarily composable in this kind of way so you have different uh different groups that could be working so you could see it scaling to just outside of dragons and kitties it could be you could build like entire ecosystems of software yeah in I mean especially in the decentralized finance space that's been popping up the last two years there's been a huge amount of really interesting things happen as a result of this is it particular kind of like Financial applications kind of thing yeah I mean there's like stable coins so this is a kind of tokens retain value um equal to $1 but they're kind of backed by cryp uh cryptocurrency then there's decentralized exchanges um so well as far as decentralized exchanges goes there's this uh really interesting construction that um has existed for about one one and a half years now called un swap so what Unis swap is it's a smart contract that holds balances of two tokens we'll call them token a and token B and it maintains an invariant that the balance of token a multiplied by the balance of token B has to equal the same value and so the way that you trade against a thing is basically like you have this kind of curve you know like x * yals K and before you trade it's at some point on the curve after you trade you just like pick some different any any other point on the Curve curve and then whatever the Delta X is that's the amount of a tokens you provide whatever the Delta Y is that's the amount of B tokens you get or vice versa and that's just and then kind of the slope um at the current point on the curve and of is the price um and so that just is the whole thing and that just allows you to have this exchange for tokens and even if there's very few participants and the whole thing is just like so simple and it's just very easy to set up very easy to participate in and it just provides so much value to people so and uh the uh the fundamental the the distributed application infrastructure allows that somehow yes so this is a smart contract meeting this is all a computer program that's just running on ethereum Smart contracts too are just fascinating they are okay do you think crypto currency may become the main currency in the world one day so where do you think we're headed in terms of the role of currency the structure type of currency in the world I definitely expect um Fiat currencies to continue to exist and continue to be strong and I definitely expect kind of Fiat currencies to also digitize in their own way over the next couple of decades what's fiat currency by the way oh just like things like US Dollars and like dollars and euros and Yen and these other things and they're sort of backed by governments yes but I also expect of cryptocurrencies to play the kind of important role in just making sure that people always have an alternative if uh Fiat currencies start breaking so like if or if you're in you know some a very high inflation place like Venezuela for example or if uh your country just kind of gets cut off of from like um cut off from other Financial systems because of something the banks do like if any kind of if there's even like some major trade disruption or something worse happens then like cryptocurrencies are the sort of thing that just because of their kind of global neutrality they're just kind of always there and you can keep using them it's interesting that you're quite humble about the possibilities of the future of cryptocurrency you don't think there's a possible future where it becomes the main set of currency because it feels like f it feels like the centralized control by governments of currency limiting somehow maybe my naive utopian view of the world it's uh it's definitely very possible uh I mean I think like for cryptocurrencies being the main form of of value to of work well like you do need to have some much more price stability than they have today and I mean there are now stable coins and there are kind of crypto cryptocurrencies that try to be more stable than existing things like Bitcoin and ether but that just is like to me kind of the main challenge do you think oh that's do you think that's a characteristic of just just being the early days it's such young concept that 10 years is nothing in the history of money yeah and I think it's a combination of two things right one is is um it's uh uh it's still early days but the other is a kind of more durable any kind of economic problem which is that like demand for currency is volatile right because of like recessions booms changes to technology lots of things and of people's demand for how much currency they want to hold changes and if you have a currency that has a fixed Supply then the change in demand has to be entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency and so what that means is that kind of the volatility of demand becomes entirely translated into volatility and kind of prices of things that dominated in that currency but if you have a currency where instead the supply can change and so the supply can kind of go up when there's more demand then you have the supply kind of absorbing more of that volatility and so the price of the currency would absorb less of the volatility on that topic so Bitcoin does have a limited Supply specific fixed Supply yes uh what's what's the idea and ethereum doesn't but can you clarify just in the comment you just made is ethereum qualify to the kind of currency that you're talking about and being flexible in the supply and it's a bit more flexible but kind of the thing that you would really want is something that's kind of specifically flexible in response to how valuable the currency is and and I'd recommend you look at stable coins as well so like things like d for example it's like how do you spell that Dai and uh what's stable coins is it a type of cryptocurrency it is a type of cryptocurrency it's um a type of cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract one of these ethereum computer programs that um where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically like that people deposit and then it issues die and the reason why people deposit is because they wants to kind of go high leverage on their ether and so it kind of pairs these two sets of users one that wants stability and one that kind of wants extra risk together with each other and it basically creates some or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll be P that they have this asset that can that can be later converted back into ether but specifically at kind of the $1 rate and it has some kind of uh stabilizing Network effects yeah it has this yeah it has many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it that's fascinating okay this this world is awesome technically just from a scientific perspective it's an awesome world uh that I I often don't see from an Outsiders perspective what I often see is kind of uh maybe hype and a little bit if I may say so like charlatanism MH and you don't often see at least from my Outsiders perspective the beautiful science of it and the engineering of it I mean maybe is there a comment you can make of who to follow how to learn about this world without being um interrupted by the charlatans and the hype people in the space I think you do need to just know the specific kind of just people to follow like there's and there's all the kind of the cryptographers and the researchers and there's just like even just the ethereum research crew like myself and like Dan CR Danny Justin of the other people and then and of the academic cryptographers and I like before um um this today I was at Stanford and Stanford has the center for blockchain research and of Dan Bonet that's really a famous and great cryptographer um is running it and there's a lot of other people there and there's people working on zero knowledge proofs for example and um Zuko from zcash is of one other person that I respect so I think if you follow the technical just crawl along that start with Ean group and then look at the academics Deon and so on and then just cautiously expand the network of people you follow yeah exactly and like if someone seems too too self-promotional then just like remove them is there books that are there's these white papers we just discussed about about ideas being Condes to really small parts is is there books that are emerging that are kind of good uh introductory material for so for historical ones and there's like Nathaniel Popper's digital gold which is just about the history of Bitcoin there's like one I think Matthew lysing announced that there's one about the history of ethereum um for technical ones and there's Andre soplos is mastering ethereum great so",

    "content": "[Music] welcome to econ 102 where economists Noah Smith and I make sense of what's happening in the news technology business and Beyond through the lens of Economics let's Jump Right In hey listeners today we're sharing a special episode from our friends at bankless in this conversation recorded for the bankless podcast in June Noah and E co-founder vitalic buin explore whether cheap information in the internet age could give authoritarian regimes an advantage over liberal democracies up ahead the two debate Technologies potential to either help or hinder liberalism it's a great discussion if you haven't already subscribe to their podcast and learn more at www.bank.com podcast or click the link in the show notes the Chinese government and the Russian government have a lot of resources devoted to pushing their message out there and the US government doesn't right liberalism doesn't US Government sits back and says you know from an Olympian remove and is like I am the overall Mighty hegemon of information and so I'm going to let all these tiny little actors play it out you know and then one of those tiny little actors is the government of China a country four times the size of United States with you know arguably a higher GDP in the United States welcome to banglas where we explore the case for authoritarianism what did I just say what get into that this is Ryan John Adams I'm here with David Hoffman and we're here to help you become more bangless now I want to make it clear before we get into this episode both of our guests today do not want authoritarianism to win the 21st century okay quite the opposite quite the opposite I think both have dedicated their lives in various ways to pursuing anti-authoritarian ideas and vitalic uh case Technologies so today's episode is more of a Steelman the question is if totalitarianism out competes free Society and wins the 21st centuries how might it win and what if the information Anarchy of the internet spells the downfall of liberalism this is a fascinating conversation with Noah Smith who is an economist and vitalic Butrin who you know from crypto I I would call this topic a non- crypto topic today but actually game theorizing on how the authoritarians might beat us might just be the most crypto thing ever David Bist were of course known to be a crypto podcast but if you are a longtime listener of bankless you know that at the end of the crypto crypto Rabbit Hole comes conversations on how do we structure society and which structures do better than others and how should we prepare for uh unfavorable structures like authoritarianism and how can we prevent that in the first place and with this episode we kind of skipped straight to the bottom of the rabbit hole talking about how technology is changing Society is changing and how that's going to impact the way that Society is organized so without further Ado let's go ahead and get right into the conversation with vitalic beran and Noah Smith thankas Nation we are very excited to bring on to uh repeat guests we have Noah Smith he's an economist he writes on his substack called No opinion he writes about current events macro econ geopolitics some philosophy mixed in is there anything that Noah does not write about Noah welcome back to bankless hey great to be back we also have vitalic butterin he is a uh philosopher I would say in the context of of today's conversation and uh you probably know him as a co-founder of ethereum vitalic Welcome to bankless as well thank you good to be back so we are doing this episode on a post uh an argument that Noah put out on his substack and the title of that post is how liberal democracy might lose the 21st century and I want to provide some context for why we're having a bankless episode on this like isn't bankless a crypto podcast and this is certainly a crypto adjacent topic but um I I guess I I'll give some framing for this you know when I read Noah's article I was kind of um a know your enemy type of reaction uh for me because beless listeners will know we are very much a friend of uh liberalism in U you know lowercase L you know Civic rights Free Speech free markets private property we want that to succeed I mean we have a horse in this race and I think in order to help it succeed you have to understand the the points at which it will fail liberalism that is so in the in the past I think especially in in the way that I was brought brought up I've been guilty of a blind faith in liberalism you know like it'll obviously win I think I'm sort of a may maybe a victim of just like a child in the US like growing up in the 9s uh and I don't want to live in a blind faith of like liberalism will always win I want to live in an actual reality and I think that's why Noah's article was so uh instructive and so uh Noah has this argument for how authoritarianism might actually outcompete Western liberal democracies and vitalic I think you called his argument I saw a a forecaster a tweet about this the strongest case for authoritarianism so uh I I think you thought it was a pretty good case and I know you have some takes here so that's what we're going to do in today's conversation number one we want to just frame out the argument so have Noah explain it maybe vitalic have you help and then two we want to talk about maybe the counterpoints to this argument and then three we want to finish off with where do we go from here does that sound good amazing I'm getting thumbs up all right so let's start with you knowah so let's let's frame this up because I think we need some um background can you just explain what we mean by liberalism and why so many of us have this Blind Faith in it I can't be the only one so explain liberalism and and why uh it just feels like everybody thinks that that liberalism has has won already at least in the west well so when people say liberalism there's really I think um three things that they mean the first thing is markets your right to basically buy and sell stuff if you want the second is an own Stuff Etc property rights all that the second is um democracy your ability to elect your leaders and the third is kind of civil rights your ability to kind of do whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt anybody else of course that's always being who knows what that really means but but that's those are sort of the three things people mean when they say liberalism um your ability to elect your leaders live your life the way you want to and buy and sell stuff and so Noah why you start the article this way why were we raised in this this age and you say you raised in this age of liberal triumphalism like this this sense that liberalism has won already right so in in the 20th century at the beginning of the 20th century people we were just in the middle of uh the Industrial Revolution the really fastest part of it and people kind of didn't know how Society was going to be organized there were a lot of different ideas about how we were going to organize an industrial society and nobody really knew what that was going to look like and varieties of socialism from evolutionary socialism you know which is basically what Sweden looks like now to you know revolutionary socialism which is basically you know I don't know what North Korea or something Cuba maybe looks like now um so and then and then of course you had various other things social Darwinism and um and you know um various kind of racial Supremacy theories and then you had uh you know in the United States the the big idea that everyone was pushing was that both free you know free enterprise which is what we now call call economic liberalism free enterprise and democracy were both good things and that was the best way to organize Society or at least American society so that so these there were sort of all these hats in the ring of what uh you know Society is going to look like once we move from farms to factories and offices and um and I think that by the end of the 20th century that question had been answered you know in in favor of liberal democracy by most people uh you know in in China uh which was still you know still a lot poorer than America at that time they were you know experimenting with various ways to liberalize the society and people you know were were experiencing many kind of new freedoms uh new personal freedoms and uh you know economic freedoms and sort of personal freedoms if not democracy right they didn't have democracy but but you could certainly you could do a ma impersonation as a joke in 2004 or something you you know and lots of people did this professionally these Mal impersonators they were women by the way dress up as M and so um and so you know and of course had the yelton period and um and even in the early Putin period people thought like oh Putin's going to be a liberal blah blah blah because he had the supportive educated sort of liberal thinking Elites in the city and so by the by the end of the 20th century by the 1990s and early 2000s I think that people generally thought okay this is what works it was Francis fukiyama uh you know thesis the end of History blah blah blah and so I think that now it's the strength of China that's really challenging that and not just the strength of China but the weakness of the the United States so so the United States uh has looked remarkably weak since um at least 2008 so you know in in the in the war on terror period the United States looked kind of of angry and pissed off about 911 was becoming less liberal um but then in in 2008 you know the United States economic you know model sort of appeared to have collapsed the kind of financialized uh capitalism that we had and then in you know after the election of trump and the the you know divisive rise of social media movements I would say people started asking okay is this Society just total chaos and then um and then after that you know we we started discovering all these things that our society had lost seemingly lost the ability to do like build housing right or build trains or build literally anything and so so America got this image as the build nothing country and China almost seem a mirror image of that whereas in China you could build anything you want because the government just says do it and you do it and um you know China was was economically growing and strong and then if you go to their cities you see giant glittering new malls and massive High train stations and beautiful highspeed trains they can take you anywhere really fast and you see um you know LEDs on all the buildings right and then and then drones delivering stuff right to your doorstep I don't know or little little delivery robots anyway and so then um so all these things I think have caused people to question was fukuyama not just wrong but the opposite of right is uh you know is China style authoritarianism actually going to win now is that is that the model that that works now and so I was trying to think okay how could that be true you know of course it's possible that there's no model that really works and it's all just contingent in the fact that China happens to be this really big country that has historically authoritarian instincts and happens to be only third of American per capita GDP anyway and uh you know is sort of in its Rising phase and looks really strong and and just happens to be really big and it's all just this big illusion and they put LEDs on the buildings but actually they don't really look that nice but I want to steal man the idea that authoritarianism is going to win in the 21st century and I thought okay so how do I do that right and I thought what was the strength of liberalism why why did we think it might have succeeded in the 20th century and why might that uh strength turn into a weakness now in the 21st century and the only thing I could think of was the internet that's the only thing that's different now like people aren't different like very much right we're tiny we have less lead poisoning maybe I don't know but like um you know industry isn't that different like there's a few different things the main thing that's different now between now and 1992 is the internet and so I was thinking how could the internet have totally changed the game in terms of whether liberalism or you know sort of I don't know authoritarian totalitarian ISM whatever uh naturally is stronger and so I thought well the internet's all about information so what's the strength of liberalism with regard to information the strength of liberalism with regard to information everybody will tell you fried Hy will tell friedrick haek will tell you and a lot of people tell you it's to aggregate information so briefly H's theory is that a market Aggregates information about costs and uh and preferences and that you know you know what to produce right producers know what to produce because they know what people want to buy and they know what their costs are going to and going to be and and consumers know what to consume because you know they know what the producers costs are going to be and so the analogously you can think of democracy as revealing information about what voters want and you can think of you know civil society as revealing information about how people want to live right people argue about whether they like this or that music I don't know or um uh whether they think gay marriage is okay so then you you aggregate this stuff with public debate the marketplace of ideas so you can think of liberalism as this giant information aggregator now how does the internet change that well the internet um makes information aggregation much easier right so we can get information much more easily maybe that actually reduces the benefit of of liberalism because it reduces you know you can an authoritarian State can get much better data about what to produce what to tell people to produce and uh you know an authoritarian State can get much better in you know information about whether the voter whether the citizenry is angry and you need to respond to what they want and you can get much better information about what kind of things what kind of behaviors you can restrict with only pissing off a few people well versus what kind of behaviors you you would piss off everybody by restricting and so authoritarian states can get all this information from the internet especially with AI especially with sort of universal surveillance kind of that your phone is like a surveillance device that tells you everything about what everything you do in your whole life can send to a central party apparatus or something authoritarian organ and um tell you everything about you and so now maybe that information gathering has gotten so easy for authoritarian States now now that doesn't mean I think they're better at it because of Technology but maybe they're less bad maybe they're they still have a disadvantage but it's ameliorated right it's it's less bad than it used to be meanwhile what advant maybe there were some advantages that authoritarian States always had over liberal states that have gotten worse have gotten more pronounced in the age of the internet so for example disadvantages of liberalism that were always there that have been exact mated by the internet and so I thinking okay well uh in the internet we spend all our time on Twitter just arguing and the smartest people in the world are wasting their time arguing on Twitter like with complete idiots who think that like you know they're like but did you adjust the inflation adjusted graph for inflation and like how many time like is it is it worthwhile to have the highest IQ people on the planet sitting there explaining once again that yes inflation adjusted means you have adjusted for inflation thank you very much and so that's you know giant waste of time and so when I look at Financial capitalism I look at you know Elon Musk literally had to to drive himself nuts to just to get funding enough funding to build some cars whereas the people who run byd did not in China right they did not have to drive themselves nuts maybe they're nuts anyway I've never met them but Elon had to basically break himself with stress over the model 3 roll out raising money to do this thing because the funding wouldn't wouldn't give him the money just you know because like oh car is cool and like and so maybe um maybe this is analogous to a lot of things in financial capitalism maybe the idea that uh fundraising for long-term projects is so godamn hard that uh because everybody is out there saying it'll never work it'll never work and the there it will work you know or just bullshitting pumping and dumping and blah blah blah blah blah that in order to keep the fickle Market focused on a very long on providing capital for a very long-term project uh you know for a a large public company maybe that's just not possible and that's why GM and Ford and all these old line companies seem so unresponsive is because the everything is just quarterly earnings and it's the information tournament where you have to you know if you really want to invest for the future you've got to spend inordinate excessive amounts of time uh you know on the internet yelling that you're good um and so maybe this was always a problem with financial capitalism and I think it probably was but now that the internet allows massive real-time dissemination of information like all the people who said the model 3 would never work and would break Tesla and Tesla would die and it would never nobody would buy it and would never succeed right they were all those people they're like Tesla's going to fail Tesla's gonna fail and then you know that that has what required Elon Musk to drive himself NS fundraising and I think that that maybe that is so so I think of this as an information tournament you've got people yelling  and you've got people yelling truth and truth does not automatically drive out because is very easy and cheap to generate right you don't um it's really easy to make a misleading graph you know it's hard to make a graph that teaches you something it's easy to make a graph that that if you decide on your point ahead of time you just want to Bullit it's easy to make that graph it's easy to make  arguments from an ideological standpoint it's like an ideological ideology is like a muscle suit so everybody just you know herps their derp as I as I would love to say um and so everybody just throws their ideology you know into the into the ring and and it just becomes this giant shouting match and so meanwhile in China they're just like okay there's just one ideology it's Xin pink thought what is shin pink thought well it's not really anything interesting it's just this one dude and he's sort of a boomer conservative and he's like let's make some cars let's not make internet stuff the internet stuff is not real Innovation let's make cars instead D and that's not that's not optimal right you're not you haven't really optimized but maybe that's less bad than having a bunch like a bunch of people Screech that like you know are rising the price of literally anything is because corporations are profit gouging and you know the the corporations the the evil corporations are hoarding all the stuff and you know like maybe um obviously we're dealing with with very many very flawed systems here there's no perfect system but maybe in the age of the internet the internet helps authoritarians get real information you know uh for for all his for all his you know authoritarianism xiin ping was also able to see the white paper protests uh in in covid lockdowns and know really early know really quickly through the internet when to cancel zero covid right as soon as people started getting a little bit upset there were like a few hundred people at those protests and still it moved National policy so maybe authoritarianism has become more responsive in the age of the internet while liberalism has been Paralyzed by people shouting disinformation and  all day that that's a great articulation of it and I I want to continue to steal man this um and eventually V vitalic want you to kind of weigh in and and try to um articulate what no is saying here but uh no no let's continue to Steelman the argument because you made a whole bunch of connections that I just want to uh reinforce but your basic idea is that totalitarianism might be better adapted to this world that we find ourselves in in the 21st century and the core uh reason why is because as you say the internet or the cost of information has uh gotten very cheap right as whereas in the 20th century maybe the cost to produce information was a lot higher and so this technological shift of cheap information has really um possibly given totalitarian authoritarian regimes a fitness advantage like like kind of in this darwinian struggle of of uh which society is going to produce the the most economic output and so let's just reinforce that a little bit um this idea that uh liberal democracies are information aggregators I think Bank list listeners will be more familiar with um the idea of of capital markets as information aggregators there's um you know there's that clip that Milton Friedman um pencil clip where he talks about how it's from the 1980s we included Link in the show notes but he basically holds up a pencil and he says um you know no single person knows how to make this pencil from from scratch and then he goes through all of the different components of the pencil you know the the graphite inside the rubber the rubber all of it sourced from different um places in the world and he makes the point that all of these things require specialized skills and and labor and so something as mundane as a pencil is really this unique creation of capitalism and isn't it great that we can all coordinate uh around price systems and have Market signals we could do this without War you know we can do this in a in a peaceful way and so that is kind of like information aggregation Theory as as applied to to Capital but what about um applying that to democracies so what about the idea that I think is is core to your uh argument here that liberal democracies are information aggregators and so they're they have a superiority in their ability to um you like aggregate information effectively like leading to better decisions and like more buyin in public goods that wasn't necessarily clear to me going into this episode could could you steal man that a little bit why are democratic uh liberal democracies a like information aggregators and why have they in the 20th century had a had an advantage there right so I would I would direct you to Bruce Bueno de mosquito's selectorate Theory which is really interesting Theory um the is in Liberal in a democracy right so so we have the same understanding of of how cap of markets how markets aggregate uh information but let's talk about democracies also aggregate information just a different way um and so when you have uh say you have two parties right and one part's like I'm going to raise your taxes I'm going to lower your tax and the other party says I'm going to lower your taxes and the party that says I'm going to raise your taxes says okay I'm going to buy I'm going to raise your taxes and I'm going to buy you Healthcare with that right and the other part is like uh uh no I'm going to lower your taxes and you can go buy your own Healthcare if you want or you can buy whatever you want and so those are the two ideas on offer and so the question is well what what are the what do what do the masses want right um and so then you have people vote based on that this is an incredibly simplified stupid model obviously but uh this is the first model you learn in in public economics uh because it's just illustrative right it's an illustrative example and so then you have people vote on which of these they like better do you like the high tax High Services uh candidate or do you like the low tax slow Services candidate better and then you vote on them and if more people want High tax High Services they'll vote for that candidate and if less people want it they'll vote for the other candidate and so then by voting you in you aggregate information about what people want about people's preferences and this is by the way this is called the median voter theorem you've heard of it um and so that's the idea of the the the median preference um you know gets into policy because then the candidates do what they say they're going to do and everything works nice and and then you get either you get your high tax High service Denmark or you get your low tax low Service uh you know I don't know Hong Kong whatever you got I know they didn't really have a democracy anyway you you you we can't use the United States for that anymore because we're not that anymore of but um but then uh you and Singapore is way different um but but so there's no there's no real libertarian you know example I can use versus that but but this is how people used to talk about this so that's that's how uh democracies aggate information now are democracy perfect information aggregators well no uh but neither are markets there's reasons why this information aggregation fails and so the idea that democracy is the least bad system uh you know which is a famous Winston Churchill quote this idea came from the idea that well when you have a a totalitarian state when you have you know Nikolai chesu is in charge right and nobody's like you know he's like oh I'll ban abortion I'll do these other things that he like thinks are right because he and his and his buddies think that and his all the guys around him are like that sounds legit let's do that and then but that then the normal people don't like it and they're and he's like oh well okay they and moan but it's just a few loud people blah blah blah but because you don't have the aggregation because you they can't vote for chesu and you you can't see him punished at the polls you can't see him thrown out you know in favor of some other leader blah blah blah the leadership just doesn't realize what the people really want and so does things that the people don't want and then gets thrown out violently via Revolution which Causes Chaos in society which leads to you know uh problems and so although maybe in the long term it's good you know it's good but then in you know it's better if you can throw the bums out uh with an election than throwing them out by hanging them from a gas station and by burning the capital and so that's that's the idea of democracies aggregating information about what voters actually want balic you put this into a pretty interesting metaphor that I kind of want to uh bring up in this point of the conversation uh in on warp caster which is uh where we saw your interest in this article you say this might be the strongest case for authoritarianism and then you link to Noah's article basically the war for people's hearts and Minds has no stable equilibrium except local hemony of one dominant Elite much like and for the same reasons as what Hobbs points out for regular war and so this is Thomas Hobbs Leviathan concept that I think you're alluding to and you're saying Hobbs alludes to this idea first there's a a global state of Anarchy uh and then there's a war against all which suppresses the Anarchy which leads to a governing governing Elite of a with a monopoly on Force which is kind of like how we have the stable equilibrium of countries to this day and you uh allude to the fact that this produces a same pattern with uh instead of a a state of physical Anarchy you have a state of information Anarchy where and I think again alluding to the fact that like putting out a tweet is so cheap these days and so the same pattern exists where like if we want truth we kind of need a governing Elite of a monopoly of memes is kind of how you say it maybe you could also just like add to this uh uh illustration of just like what happens when like information markets and capital markets uh interact with each other and how they can kind of get distorted and and overall just how you resonated with Noah article yeah and so I think you definitely gave a pretty good introduction to I guess the thesis already right but basically if you think of like what the public discourse game is and like you imagine the most pessimistic possible interpretation of the public discourse game there is basically no truth SE and instead what you have is you have multiple tribes and each of these tribes basically you know fires off a a type of know like missile or warship or know like what tank or whatever that's could be a meme or could be an an article could be a tweet or a video or whatever and uh often know these a million of these info missiles fired at you would have some common themes and so you have one group that's like basically trying to essentially have their memes colonize your brain and then you have a different group that's also trying to have their memes that are completely different memes go and colonize your brain and so you basically have this like zero sum conflict right it's like you know if we say you know one side is pushing capitalism the other side is uh pushing um socialism that or if you say if let's say you know it's a foreign policy issue and like let's say know Greenland and you know Sweden are at War and you know you have one group saying you know support Greenland and the other saying support Sweden and like these are just like very Zero Sum things and like you have people pushing in One Direction you have people pushing in the other direction and it basically all kind of roughly yeah STS up to zero and you just have like a huge amount of wasted effort huge amount of stress a huge amount of people not getting literally killed but you definit get like much worse life emotional experiences than they otherwise would and so you basically ask the question of like okay so you have this war of all against all that looks very similar to a war between two armies to conquer territory except instead of it being two armies battling over a forest you have two meme armies battling over each and every person's brain and you ask like what is the equivalent of a p treaty right and the equivalent of a peace treaty is so one basically you know in the yian case like you have local territorial monopolies right and then after that you know you had you know things like the Treaty of West faia which like formalized a lot of this and then they kept going further and further from there basically you know saying that like you know we have this notion of territory and within each uh territory then you know you have a local Monopoly right and actually theia's example is interesting right because I think that was also when the concept of Rego AIO right like he who has the region has the religion um came about right basically know one of the ideas is that kind of the local uh like monarch would also have the ability to choose the religion of the country and uh so here so an interesting example to hearen back to because they're basically saying like like even back back then kind of you know recognize that like this concept of uh like one person having hemony over a piece of territory and then different people having hij over different pieces of territory is something that applies to physical war and it's also something that can in the same way apply to information War right and so the way that this works in you know the space of information war is basically like okay yeah you know you have one country and you know in the one country you're supposed to the only memes that are allowed to spread are the Shen ping thought memes and you have another country and then in that other country the only memes that are allowed to spread are some different memes in the Third Country you have some different memes that are allowed to spread right and you have this kind of equili where basically you don't have at least as much you know as some medic Warfare because for every country there is like one dominant Elite that like has a reliable hold over the me war right and like other there might be other groups that want to you know get their beavs out into the me war but they're just like so much less powerful than the dominant party that like it's you know it's like the US governments versus like random cultists and Texas or whatever right that like you know the second group has no chance and so most of the time they don't try so there's no Bloodshed um so that's kind of the analogy that um I made between you know I would say um authoritarianism though it's a a very related concept I would say like info hegemony as opposed to info infop pluralism might be one of the ways to think about it and how things ended up turning out with physical Warfare and so basically one of the things that this thesis then implies is that if there is this analogy then if we want to argue that info pluralism is something that's actually yet better than info hegemony then we might want to look for deep and enduring reasons why physical war and mimore actually are different from each other we'll continue our

information because the cost to produce information has um been very cheap and the only remedy is that we have some sort of uh centralized Monopoly on information almost like a a Ministry of of truth right it that's the the force that will you know bring bring equ ibrium and and cure the Anarchy right and so that that's the idea here Noah could you make the jump for us because I'm still not clear on the jump between you said the internet may have possibly brought this about and so the cost of information the the price to create information has maybe plummeted or the cost to distribute information has has plummeted why why is the cost to distribute propagate information going down why why does that help uh totalitarian type of regimes and ministries of of truth that that link is not quite clear I I think in the case we've made so far all right so there's a cell phone maybe in your pocket or close to you right now unless you've taken extraordinary precautions that cell phone transmits information records information about your entire life everything you do everything you buy everything you search for everyone you talk to everything you say to people online maybe in real life too if it is sneaky enough but but certainly online um where you are day to day minute to minute that cell phone that little brick knows everything about you and so what can that tell someone well if you're a large corporation or if you're a government who owns a bunch of large corporations or a government it can tell you what you'd like to buy you know it can mine your data and say oh you know I think this guy really likes broccoli now maybe I'll go produce some broccoli so that can can aggregate information about what you what you want right um so of course it can do it in the hayekian way right in in hyek you need prices right how do you know whether people like broccoli you look at you look at um price data if the price of broccoli goes up that means maybe people like broccoli more now but on your phone you can see exactly who liked broccoli when they bought broccoli what they were doing when they bought broccoli whether they were talking about broccoli whe they searched for broccoli blah blah blah you can get a lot of information about that and that's information that you couldn't get in 1957 that's information you couldn't get in in 1995 and that's information that's now available know what can I just like re regurgitate that just just to make sure I I totally understand um the the way that I wasn't trained in uh as an economist like you were but just like as a meme I always understood like why did Communism fail oh because like Central planning is inefficient right it just doesn't have the information that a frv market Capital capitalistic Market has but I think what you're saying is like there's such a strong centralization of information due to modern technology that all of a sudden like Central planning perhaps has a lot more of information that it previously would not have had thanks to technology I I think that's like what you're saying in a short way right and and the hypothesis here is that it's gone from um it's gone from being say 20% as good as free markets to being 60% as good as free markets it's still significantly worse but the disadvantage is less and perhaps that disadvantage is now small enough where it can be more than compensated for by advantages in other domains that's the hypothesis uh of course I think that personally you know I I was a briefly a finance professor and I think you know about uh Capital allocation things like that um personally I obviously whether people want to buy broccoli or not is the that's the the classic you know example right but um but if you think about uh productive if efficiency which companies are best suppose you have uh one one country uh where the government is allocating money to companies and saying okay you can have this much funding you can have that much funding and another country where how much funding you get is based on you know your your uh you know a whole bunch of investors deciding what what price to value your stock at and what interest rate to charge you in the bond market right so and then in the other one you just have some banks which are owned by the government saying okay we think you're going to have good opportunities or we're get money right you get you get you get investment capital and so maybe the fact that may so the internet can provide the people doing you know loan evaluation or whatever with massively more amounts of of information about both who's buying their products and how their stuff is organized and what their technology is like and and all these things about a company that you you just couldn't get that information 1995 even if you you know like um and I know because the Japanese bureaucracy really tried and they were they weren't they you know midi was was constantly behind the curve on this and they were the best of the best back in the in the '90s they were just rack Camp one L after another doing this and of course the when the Japanese economy thrived it was often you know kind of uh because people just went around to MIDI um you know sometimes sometimes midi did have some big successes but that's another topic um and that was mostly earlier but then so I guess the idea is that maybe the internet you know the massive amounts of data we we when we say the internet we don't just mean like people arguing on Twitter right we don't just mean people podcasting like we're doing now we also mean things like the massive data collection so the the amount of data about uh you know buying behaviors and and demand and and what people are doing with their day work day you know and whether people are productive and all these things and about who has what technology in their company the the amount of information is vastly greater we store massive amounts of information so databasing is really the thing here um and so data basing and then the fact that it's all networked means you can transmit it easily but uh you know you can run regressions on it too we have um much more information about what companies are doing how they do it and what they might be able to do in the future than we did 20 years ago 30 years ago and so um an authoritarian State might be able to use that to allocate Capital say that before they were only 20% as good at allocating Capital as a you know market economy let's say now they're 60% as good at allocating Capital as a market economy well that has sign significantly eroded their disadvantage uh you know they're still disadvantaged maybe markets are still the best you know and Hayek's still formly right but the the the difference has shrunk to the point where authoritarian States's other strengths that were always there can now shine through more uh so that's the that's the worry you know I don't think this is true necessarily I just think it's a worth thinking and worrying about I don't think any of this is true you know I'm I'm making a case here I'm being a bit of a lawyer for this idea because I don't really strongly believe that this is right and I also think that like you know I I I fervently hope that in in 20 years we'll be saying well that's why Xin Ping's you know regime collapsed because you know obviously liberal democracies are much better I hope we're saying that I want to be able to say that in 20 years but I don't know standing right here I don't know what's going to happen and so I'm I'm sort of pushing this scary idea so that we can think about it uh you know so this this is the hypothesis okay so vitalic from from your mind have we sufficiently explained the argument that Noah is making or would you add anything else I know Noah you touched upon information tournaments a little bit and and kind of like the drive by explanation but um you know like maybe we could touch upon that or just like in general do you think we've we've uh articulated the case he was making in his article vitalic or what would you add yeah I mean I think I would only add one small thing which is um like you know we talked about info Hoban ISM but there's definitely a kind of generalized you know Hobs Hobs that you can talk about and like to the extent that you can model aspects of Finance as a war against all then like fine you know throw that in there like you know if you think about like you know like some like billion dollar hedge funds know like using like high leverage to try to like attack and like break particular company's positions and like if you interpret that as a zero some Behavior then like you could kind of I know squint and make a case for like putting up Financial walls to protect against that um then know you can apply similar ideas to I me potentially like offline kind of Internet things potentially to know like the the biospace like basically it's a pretty generalizable argument and so you can try to like apply it issue by issue to know like different kinds of things and basically see you know like is this a zero some game that's like analogous to physical Warfare in the right ways and in that it feels like it has the same equilibrium and like if it feels like it doesn't then you know can like actually look like dig into the specific example and explore the reasons why yeah one example that Noah gives maybe this gets into the idea of like wasteful information tournaments that might be going on in like Western liberal democracies is the idea of an election and uh no you you commented that the average US politician spends about 30 hours of their work week actually just trying to raise funds raise capital in order to what in order to go get elected again and it's like which leaves you the question of how much of their time is actually spent on governing and the the the question of well is this just wasteful right it's like will a uh a regime that does not need to have elections will that regime just out compete uh maybe govern more spend spend the 40- hour work we actually governing um not wasting all this capital on on getting elections so is part of the idea here Noah that we have this this this waste going on in uh liberal democracies and you know H how would you pattern match what we that with what we've discussed so far so um let's think about why uh Congress people are out there fundraising their entire time what do you use uh you know if you're if you're at holding national office what do you use money for use it for television advertisements use it for internet advert use it for ads right and um why so now suppose the other side also raises a bunch of money and uses that for ads okay um now television isn't the internet but the fact that the internet makes it very easy to spread misinformation uh you can so uh for example we've seen a lot of people uh spread you know misinformation about how good the economy is doing uh often in order to credit Biden but sometimes to defend Biden too and uh you know people have we've seen people use alternative methods of inflation that are just absolute terrible methodology but broadcast that with scary scary charts or numbers to like a whole bunch of gullible people um we've seen people do uh charts where you adjust one of the lines for inflation the other isn't to show that people's purchasing power is collapsing when actually it's not because you've just inflation adjusted the wages and you didn't inflation adjust the prices um we've seen th those are just a couple things I encounter in my daily life on the internet arguing massive disinformation and um and these memes take hold and they uh you know and a lot of people believe them right you know so how do you counter them how do you counter these memes as a politician if someone says you know someone say someone says someone shows a viral chart showing that wages are flat and prices are way way up and it's because they didn't adjust they adjusted the wages for inflation so the infl the wages you know only increase slowly well they didn't adjust the prices for inflation so price you know and so um and so they show this chart and it goes around and now you're a politician and you've actually done a good job and real wages and wages have gone up adjusted for inflation you know um real wages have gone up and you've done a good job and now you have to counter that message that it because easy to misunderstand that chart like it always goes viral because it looks really dramatic it's total disinformation like I know you should adjust inflation for both you adjust both time series for inflation if you're going to compare this is you know this is not an ambiguous case right this is just a mistake and often it's an intentional mistake people intentionally do this just to get clicks uh and so you I could do it tomorrow I could just show you how it's done right and um but I'm I'm not going to but uh but because that's not you know anyway uh but you can and people do it all the time the Wall Street Journal did it by accident once and had to like retract it so um uh so what I'm saying is how do you counter that well perhaps you can pay to put your own message out there actually real wages went up and you know you can pay to do TV ads saying real wages went up you know wages went up by this much where the cost of living only went so you could maybe you could but that costs money money money money and you have to be out there fundraising for that money all day long while someone else you know a 27y old staffer does the job of governing so the cost to um create misinformation is just like very cheap and uh it takes very high cost to sort of uh validate or verify that information is true or not so in all of this I'm curious italic you called this like sort of uh what we're up against um like you you seem to find Noah's argument that he's making pretty compelling as to why totalitarianism maybe let's call it uh could Dominate and and beat the idea of like Western um civil liberties and this is all very ironic I I think think because it would be sort of defeating a device that was supposed to propagate you know democracy and um like you know liberal values let's say which is like the internet and so the idea that a tool of uh liberal democracy creation could actually be used by totalitarian regimes to beat them at their own game is somewhat counterintuitive so why do you think why did you call this argument sort of um what we're up against and maybe like you can consider it a a good argument against against uh liberalism in the 21st century I think the idea of like infow War as a zero sum game is um one of those ideas that's like on at the top of a lot of people's minds and it's uh like it's definitely something that is concerning a lot of people and it's definitely something where if you just like go and uh you know look out onto the uh know the Twitter verse here s you know you can very clearly see evidence for it and I mean I think also just one of the interesting things about the being in the crypto space right is that know in a lot of ways know we get to be a couple years ahead to some of these Trends and you know there is definitely you know huge amounts of Zero Sum info warfare that's happening you know between ethereum and Bitcoin maximalists ethereum and uh you know the xrp Army ethereum and salana ethereum and whoever like well at least I know between the kind you know like the kind of more hawkish and maximalist factions of each of which right I think you know under the surface there's a lot of devs that actually get get along quite well that's uh kind of not visible if you just look at Twitter but like you know the infow war of all against all layer is uh definitely a layer that exists and you know we see uh how all of these Info Wars are kind of coming out and we see know the like the obvious need for some kind of you know like better way of actually doing this function of aggregating and um eliciting a lot of different people's you know wisdom and thinking power and information and a lot of what we have today is just like not actually meeting that and uh it is worth thinking of like basically yeah like what is the worst case scenario in um out of all of this and like the worst case scenario definitely like basically like seems to be like what an outcome where like all these problems don't get solved at all and the pro and you know it turns out that of the more serious verions of all the problems actually are true and actually will continue to be true and like basically nothing survives aside from you know essentially islands of uh various sizes that are running you know a very centralized way internally right yeah isn't isn't the worst casee scenario what what Noah pointed out which is basically like um liberal democracies are on their way out so in in a similar way that agricultural societies disrupted hunter gatherers and like you know industrialization kind of like um uh you know beat out the monarchies then maybe information Tech just you know spells the end of uh liberal democracies isn't that isn't that the worst case scenario for fans of liberalism yeah yeah no I think it absolutely is well I hope that that's not true maybe we can get into uh how this argument could be wrong and um I'll throw this over to to Noah to start so um you've put forth this the argument which is you know the cost to uh create information as plummets maybe it gives an advantage to totalitarian regimes and disadvantages um you know liberalism and the idea of liberalism and you know these totalitarian regimes just outcompete liberal democracies in the in the 21st century so let's talk about how this argument could be wrong and I just want to maybe throw this uh to you Noah so we've had Technologies in the past that have brought the cost to propagate information like down to zero like one of those Technologies was the printing press right and so it did not lead to new um totalitarian regimes kind of you know taking charge and and winning more or less led to a res uh Renaissance more or less led to the splintering and forking of all sorts of different you know religions uh you know protestantism sort of had its had its way with the the introduction of the printing press so it seems like we've had Technologies like the internet in the past uh and it bred more liberalism it bred more more freedom like why is that not the case here or do you think that's a compelling reason argument against the uh I asking you to maybe argue with yourself do you think that's a compelling reason for why this thesis might be wrong well could but I mean so I think that that's basically something about lowering information costs made um made liberalism strong in the 19th century and then really in the 20th century and maybe in earlier centuries too you know you can make an argument that the the 30 years war was won by the less illiberal side I they're both pretty illiberal but you could make an argument that the Protestant States at least you know um didn't have the overarching and at the time quite corrupt Catholic church and that made them more liberal and that the habsburgs were really in some sense the bad guys but uh so you can make that argument and um but I think what we're to make the argument that I'm making you need to look at nonlinearities right you need to look at a a u curve the idea is that as information becomes cheaper it becomes possible to aggregate information with mechanisms like markets more easily you can have a with the printing press you can have people and the telegram and all this stuff you can send information about prices farther and faster and this allows you to to get you know aggregate information through the price mechanism faster same with like voting you can get people to uh you know you know it's it's easier to get information about what the candidates actually want uh of course you had plenty of disinformation there there too at the time but still you had these um you you you can you can make this argument that information aggregation becomes easier with just a little bit of reduction of information aggregation costs but then those that that plateaus over time you know so you have this this you know thing where at first a little bit of of Information Technology like the printing press and the TV and the radio make it easier to aggregate preferences but then the you know the internet doesn't necessarily make it easier make it much easier on top of that to you know figure out like you know what people want to buy and stuff like that or for the for the market say to aggregate information about preferences democracy it doesn't make it much uh you know better let's say um and then let's say that uh the disadvantages might be you know a um a concave function like this right they might be an upward bending function where the information the in the the social resources that you waste on information tournaments might simply increase a lot and so you have this this crossover point right so you have um your your at first your information tournament cost is only increasing slowly while your information aggregation benefit is increasing very quickly and here's where a liberal democracy wins but then when they cross over here here's where a liberal democracy starts losing because the cost keep growing and growing and growing while the benefits asmp toote or let's say decline in you know it's um it's convex or um I mixed up concave and convex but whether the set under it anyway um so but but the the curve curve go up so so so convex costs right or and and concave uh utility is the whole idea here and you get this pattern with a lot of things right you get this pattern with like investment in the solo model of growth right the uh the your you're you have diminishing returns to Capital but you have you have straight line depreciation costs even increases increasing depreciation cost as you build more and more capital and So eventually there's some crossover point where building more stuff actually hurts you instead of building more Capital hurts you instead of helps you it's like do you need one more Bridge do you need one more you know office building and at some point it it at some point the the the balance flips right so to get this argument you need to get an argument where you have this this crossover and this flip and so um and the idea is that when information costs get you know they start out very High CU you know you're just like Grog the caveman running around your club and then as you get better technology you get information cost gets lower and lower because people learn how to write and things like that and printing press and television radio blah blah blah and liberal democracy better and better and better and then you hit some crossover point with the internet where suddenly uh you know you your benefits have just have really just ASM tooted out while your your costs continue to to explode from information tournaments so in order to make this argument you need to make an argument for a nonlinearity you can't just say more information equals more gooder or more liberer right you can't just say you that that that's a that's straight line thinking right so so you have to think nonlinearly and have some crossover point in order to make this argument but talk I'm wondering if you could give your perspective a pull in a metaphor from the uh AI safety people of just like what do you think your like P Doom is when it comes to um like totalitarian structure uh being the most fit as result of uh the the curves that that Noah is illustrating uh you talk about in your warp cast just like some um reasons about why this argument could be wrong maybe you can like give us some assurances about why this is a thought experiment and not reality well I mean I think uh one thing that we have to kind of uh nail nail down first is the difference between being the best fit and winning right because uh I think uh one property that uh a lot of like systems that are organized in a very centralized way have in practice is that like economies of scale in extraction are are higher than economies of scale in actual production and and so even if they're kind of less fit in some you know utilitarian sense of improving human flourishing like it's know they could easily still um ends up like extracting more and like succeeding more in zero some conflicts for reasons so that's like one big you know caveat that's really importance to make right um but yeah I mean in terms of like P totalitarianism or P whatever I think one of the challenges of giving this number is that it's like so hard to Define what all of these terms are even going to mean 50 years from now right because like we're talking about transitions through some like pretty massive technological change is whatever AI is going to do uh and uh you know whatever that's going to do to the global economy whatever advances in biotech are going to do um whatever um advances in just like other kinds of digital technology are going to have and uh the uh the concept of even you like something like private property it just uh in some sense becomes less and less uh meaningful with every passing year as Things become more and more digital right and as you like we're just basically yeah turning into like everything being Network effects so yeah I mean it's it's hard for me to give percentages because um like I mean there's definitely a case to be made that if you like took someone from 150 years ago and you woke them up today and you showed them how any modern society works then they would say Obviously totalitarianism has one like what do you mean you can't legally hire without like filling in a whole buch of forms and like giving them 40 like it's like the most totalitarian thing out there right so yeah it's like it's difficult to like make a a numerical comparison for like even just some of those reasons uh but you know maybe just to give some concrete or maybe to start going into the counter arguments a bit um yeah I think basically if we go back to know the info Hoban thesis right which basically says that the the info of all against one all like one is a war um so meaning it's you know a negative SU game rather than zero or or positive sum two it does not have stable equilibria that are not physical borders and three it does have stable equilibria that are physical borders right like I think those are the three claims and I think like I think you can ultimately attack each one of them in term and know we can start from the end right so does info hobis even have equilibria that are physical borders right well you know go on Twitter and one of the first things that you see is you know you you still see people from and like or bots of different countries that are uh you know act very hostile toward each other that are you know still fighting the M against each other in all kinds of different contexts right so you know even if they have very strong censorship in only like you know the MIM more continues right so like that's one question right and uh then you know we kind of joke about how like oh you know the only meemes that you're allowed to spread or I you know the local governments I know like approved thought or whatever but if feel like actually go to like any one of these countries and and possibly with the exception of North Korea though like probably even there like it's not actually like that at all right and like it's actually you know the meme ecosystem is still actually quite porous in practice so that's like the first question right like basically in a digital environment then is the natural equilibrium even like National Borders or is it the case that like oh well actual the only equum that makes s From aian perspective is one where there basically a single Elite that dominates the enti world right and that in some ways is like an even scarier thought right because we're not even talking about hegemony within one country we're talking about like a single hegemonic actor that just takes over the entire world and at that point even if they're completely unfit there's like basically no pressure that can effectively unseat them like world government is deeply scary in a way that national government is not um so then the question is like well if that's actually the case then like maybe it just there's enough people around the world that just like find that kind of scenario as horrible as I do that they'll actually start fighting against it right so that's like the first thing that I think is worth being skeptical about right like are there actually equilibria that uh don't um involve or that do involve borders and then the second one is like are there equilibria other than war that don't involve at least physical borders and I think here what's uh interesting is like like this is where a lot of the differences really start to shine right because there and this is I think something that's very second nature to the crypto space right which is basically that like the possibilities for defense exist in the in the digital world that just do not exist in the physical world right like theoretically in the physical world people can wear body armor right but in practice body armor is super inconvenient it's sweaty it is know incredibly annoying in a whole bunch of ways it's unfashionable I'll say that yeah yeah it's un I mean yeah I mean you can stick body armor into suits if you want but like I you know these days even suits are becoming more and more lame um so but but then in the digital world you know if you think about like your internet experience using um https in 2024 versus you're at experience using HTTP in 2009 like do they feel different right I mean obviously the applications feel different but like does the difference between HTTP and https feel like anything right and I think the answer is clearly no right now that's kind of a bit of a I think somewhat of an artificially unreasonable example right this gets into the Divide between what I call um cyber defense and what I call info defense in my big long techno Optimist Manifesto from last year right and basically it's like cyber defense is the type of Defense where everyone can like every reasonable person can agree who the bad guy is and info defense is like when there is room for interpretation but even in the case of info defense right you know you can ask things like what even are the physical world equivalents of community notes what are the phys IAL World equivalents of prediction markets or to even go low Tech what even are the physical world equivalents of different groups of people being able to be on different social medias and be on group chats right like one of the kind of lines of skepticism that you like I think you can really legitimately raise against inferring the extents to which the infl the is a war of all against all on Twitter is basically that like Twitter is the worst of it that you see and it's the worst of it precisely because you can see it right if you think about like private group chats for example like I you know there are like private group chats consistently maintain higher levels of quality and and high levels of productive discourse um smaller social media platforms whether it's uh you know forecast or whatever else they maintain higher levels of uh of discourse right actually like Noah even know wrote an article about how the internet wants to be fragmented and you know basically like the counterargument is like what if you know this vision of the global water cooler that we all got addicted to in the 2010s just like happens to be the worst possible version of all of this from a uh you know like info Warfare being negative some perspective and now we actually are learning and we actually are adapting and the internet is like already you a whole bunch of smaller and larger ways reconfiguring itself to be uh to already starts to become less warlike in ways that are you know that have no equivalents again in the physical world because you know the the mechanics of like constructing digital walls and constructing physical walls are just so fundamentally different so I'll stop here Noah what what do you think of those those arguments against the thesis here that vitalic just made I think that um I like the the observation about the internet becoming more fragmented uh that will reduce information tournament costs as in we don't spend all our day arguing on Twitter we spend our day talking to people in Discord who have useful information to us you know for us and who are not just some you know some angry jerk blowing off steam by talking  and then everyone else has to jump in and refute that uh and then we just talk you know talk to interesting people with interesting ideas and maybe we lose we lose a tiny bit of that long tale of information because we don't you know maybe there's some totally random person who pop up and tell you you know a little bit of extra information you didn't know that wouldn't have been invited to your Discord but um but now uh you know at least we've reduced the information tournament so I think I think that's that point I really like uh the idea that that perhaps there's some natural self-equilibration mechanisms in the kind of marketplace of ideas uh I like that idea the the analogy to hubsan ISM I think we shouldn't we shouldn't lean too hard on that analog ology to show why this idea is wrong I think yes the idea of information Tournaments has some superficial similarity and some real I mean some real similarity to Hoban ISM but it's not a complete analogy and I think uh saying okay here's why if we make everything seem exactly like Hobs is you know Leviathan you know if we just make a onetoone analogy between these Concepts and then we show how like you know we show how the the classic sort of assumptions of Hobs of Hobs don't hold well then disproven the the information tournament thesis I don't think I think we shouldn't do that we shouldn't lean too hard on that analogy and um so for example uh one idea is that is the idea the the the analogy of information competition to violence uh if I yell um if if uh if two people meet in a town square and have a physical fight right one knocks the other like if Ryan and David meet in the town square with clubs and go at it you know and then like one of them will B Bonk the other with a club and then he falls over unconscious and then you're done right but then in information uh quote unquote Warfare yes there's a competitive thing but it's like imagine if both people had like infinitely powerful suits of armor and we're just wailing on each other like in some Marvel movie so I can yell correct information someone else can yell disinformation or we can yell two competing forms of disinformation right I can tell you uh you know so suppose that you tell me that uh the job market is terrible under Biden was amazing under Trump and I tell you that the job market was terrible under Trump and his amazing under Biden well those are both wrong because it was been great under both like the job market has been great throughout both of those presidents terms and so that's the truth but suppose we we have competing disinformation right and we just wail on each other and wail on each other and wail on each other physical violence you know naturally ends in one person winning and the other person getting clubbed to death I mean yes I know World War I last a long time it's not always quick Victory but then information Warfare can go on forever and so the the you know that's just one one difference between real violence and you know disinformation war and so the cost of disinformation War there there may be no natural resolution so the thing about Hobs is that um the idea is that everyone's always running around trying to fight everyone and so you need this uh this Leviathan right that's similar to the idea that maybe having information you know filtered through some monopolis at the New York Times and CBS News and like 1960 maybe that was actually good that's the that's the analogy there but there's other dimensions in which the analogy breaks down for example borders right do we really need you know to to have information hegemons do we really need information to stop and start at National physical borders and I you know no we don't um so yes we have Twitter and you go on Twitter and you see people from all countries right but the Chinese government and the Russian government have a lot of resources devoted to pushing their message out there and the US government doesn't right liberalism doesn't US Government sits back and say you know from an Olympian remove and it's like I am the overall Mighty hegemon of information and so I'm going to let all these tiny little actors play it out you know and then one of those tiny little actors is is the government of China a country four times the size of the unit states with you know arguably a higher GDP in the United States and so that's one of the tiny little atomistic actors and so the rest of us are these tiny little tiny little guys having to run up against that Behemoth having to run up against Russia who has less resources but still a lot more than your average American and you know and is is got has a little bit more practice pushing out to Americans um and so those guy you know I'm having to fight those guys every day on on Twitter and in the information space and they're much better resourced than I am and there's no B there's no physical border there right there's a physical border for where those armies can go but there's not a physical border for where their information things go and so you can have crossborder information Warfare in a way that it's very difficult to have crossb physical Warfare and that's a structural difference between the two things that makes the analogy break down a little bit I think and so the idea that okay well information is borderless and therefore you're not going to get a Hoban situation well but information Warfare is is is borderless in a way that violent physical Warfare is is not and so I think that that means that the analogy can't you know we can't just lean too heavily on that analogy and say Well since information doesn't have borders you're not going to get a Hobs type situation well yeah but Russia and China are going to continue to just use their resources to push out their messages to everywhere and if you look at uh and and um I think is Ann Apple bom had a great article on the Atlantic recently that shows that um the combination of Russian message crafting and Chinese money uh around the world is actually proving a fairly effective propaganda tool so for example this idea that there were all these Secret biolabs in Ukraine you know that's made up by the Russians secret American biolabs in Ukraine and that's why Russia had to like go invade Ukraine that's made up by the Russians and um but it is uh being spread in in you know poor country in developing countries and in developed countries but uh by um but people in developing countries are buying it a bit more because they don't have that as robust a counter information ecosystem you know it is being spread by Chinese networks and China really picked this up and ran with it and distributed this and China's commercial connections to the world allowed it to to do this Ryan and David have you ever heard the Ukraine biolabs idea I have not no okay um balic you've heard that one yes I have but uh right and it's borderless it's borderless but but these these well-resourced states that have borders for the collection of taxes you know and borders for the enforcement of crime and borders for the where their army goes do not have borders for where their information goes and yet they in some sense raise the information cost to the rest of us because I'm sitting there battling whole governments on Twitter yeah okay I mean I think I I get the feeling that uh no I was uh sort of somewhat disagreeing with me but actually agreeing with quite a lot of know like what I said right which is that like you know like one is that it's like a major difference between um you know physical Warfare and internet Warfare is definitely that like internet war is like significantly like much less of you know like actually warlike and you know like especially once you get off Twitter and like that's a place where the analogy fails um but I think on the first one of like the issue of borders that's uh one of those one thing that's kind of valuable to disentangle there I think is like the idea of like info hegemony as this some as abstract concept right which can exist at any level of a stack right like you can have info hgy in a country you can have info hgy inside one of Elon musk's companies you can have like info hegemony in your family or in your cult or across the entire world um and then there is kind of this like much more specific ideology that like really emphasizes the idea ofal sovereignty and basically treats um info hegemony as being one part of national sovereignty alongside like you know like physical military hegy within a local area right and I think the breakdown in the analogy between know like physical and info hobis like it basically to me defitely suggests that specifically the nation state bound version of all of this is one that's less likely to be a long-term stable equilibrium right but like which could mean something good or it could mean something bad right the the good thing that it means could be that we find some kind of better uh better approach and some kind of better equilibrium that does not involve like basically unlimited you know like info hegemony that any particular person is subjected to right or it could also mean something worse and the something worse is basically info hegemony at an actually worldwide level right and so the the question to basically think about is like well if you you know like have all of these different like actors and we could think of them as being Nations or in some cases they you know they're like mexes that have partial overlap with Nations sometimes they mexes that overlap collections of D or even Parts oftion like if you are one of these mexes what to do is the ultimate safety the ultimate safety is basically banishing all Computing mexes from the world forever right because if they're not from the world then like wherever they're not banag from they can come back right and so this is of the bigger risk which is basically going out even into the long long term into a a time when you know like even you know the words you know like democracy and totalitarianism and you know like United States and what like Russia and so on are long forgotten like what is you know like the longterm equilibrium and like is that a global info heden and is that like a situation that eventually you know like we fall into and once we fall into it's like super hard to get out of right so yeah I think like basically the poorest of like wayal borders are weaker than borders it's like it's a blessing and a curse in that exact way it's like you know the the blessing is basically that it enables other possibilities and like the curs is that like well actually you know there's definitely something worse than Nation scale authoritarianism that's you might be looking at us event yes so so right so in other words um right now uh we're seeing we're seeing so-called sharp Power by China reach into many areas of the rest of the world we're seeing companies censor what they say in their own home markets because of China threatening to cut off access to the Chinese market we're seeing um you know and and various various actors basically China's conditional opening saying we'll we'll dangle the the promise of this giant Chinese market which usually does not materialized but let's say we can dangl in once in a while it will for anyone who's just willing to go push our message in your own back in your own countries blah blah blah that's called sharp power um and so we're seeing the effects of that across borders the question is so so what's the scenario I I guess my question so so again I don't really strongly believe in this thesis right it's just an idea I had I'm not going to be like yes liberal democracy is going to fail I'm not that guy right I think that there's a good chance that that everything I'm saying here is overblown and that this is not even a good way of and that liberal democracy has other advantages in addition like incl a feeling of inclusiveness and you know uh public goods provision those are other Arguments for why liberal democracy is good maybe those are more important and I just haven't even considered them maybe the information tournament problem isn't actually that big and what looks like you know um all these people wasting these resources actually just people having fun well actually we're just as good at getting information as we ever were which never was really great but we're just watching people have fun sh shouting each other for consumption purposes and that's how we're using our leisure time and it looks like we're you know but in actuality you go back to like 1950 and the average person was worse informed than now and that the actual amount of time and effort we spent was maybe about the same because now we're just consuming we're just having fun so these are counterarguments that I can make to this right I can make counterarguments to everything I just said um but but I think it's worth asking if this thesis if the scary theory is wrong and if the if the new totalitarianism is going to lose you know if Xin ping ism is going to lose what's the scenario by which it loses and so I think economically the scenario by which it loses is that well China's still just not nearly as rich as the west and as this Chinese state gets more controlling of the Chinese economy it's going to get worse and worse it's already slowing down much faster than other you know developed countries did back in their day it's slowing down early and is just you know yeah they can produce a bunch of EVS but they're all going to rust in the parking lot and um you know unless they're massively subsidized and in the end all we have to all we have to do you know is wait and maybe they'll be Soviet Union too and so that's economically I think that's the argument um politically the argument is eventually you when the economy slows down and when people realize that xiin ping isn't that competent and he's like been around for like 20 years and people get really restless you're going to see the same pressures you saw in Korea and Taiwan uh you know no for democratization blah blah blah so those are the counterargument the counter arguments are just like just wait bro like people said totalitarianism was going to win in the 30s they said it was going to win in the 70s they were full of both those times and they're full of now just wait you know wait and like do the normal thing and and but in terms of the the marketplace of information with the massive messaging apparatuses of China and and to some degree Russia um which are now coordinating you know Hedon in the American internet with and the European internet with and the Latin American internet and the Middle Eastern with you know how do we beat that like what's the scenario so this is my question to vitalic uh what's the scenario where that loses and how does it lose so I think one of the sets of arguments that we haven't talked about at all is just the uh possibly very large uh benefits of uh inflow Pro pluralism in a cont like in a Contex where like when people are sharing info they're doing something other than fighting each other right um so I think one of the best things that you can have in an ecosystem is like not just having like one group that has a tight internal consensus where they all agree with each other on everything and then they just kind of Veer off in their own Direction and assume that like each other are right have perfect perfect confidence in each other and instead actually like have an ecosystem where you have different groups that actually like have some form of competition with each other right and this is know like something that the world as a whole definitely has like as a unit this is something that I mean the us as a country I think is definitely has you know quite a bit of that as a unit you know like there's know you can identify know like sub bubbles in a bunch of ways right like you have the Reds and the blues I you know you have the east coast and the you know like intellectual cluster then you have silon Valley you have people who care about know different branches of tech and like there's lots of these subcultures that actually have the ability to actually push take their ideas and like actually push them forward to their kid cusion and start executing on them um this is something that uh I think the better crypto ecosystems tends to um actually have right and you know the ones where it it like actually literally is just a cult of personality be around you know like one guy calling the shots are like the the the ones that you like pretty quickly tends to fail sorry Craig um the the benefits of like actually having this kind of pluralistic environment where like you actually have different groups and where those different like each of those different groups like actually has enough breathing room that it can actually take a couple of steps that actually start like pushing its ideas forward to some kind of inclusion like that feels like something that like it's very plausible to believe that it's something that has massive benefits and like you just can't really come up with good ideas without it right and I think what's interesting about that is that the kind of world where know like there's like one um know like leading dictator and like you can't get anywhere if you disagree is like obviously the exact opposite of that but then the world water cooler is also the exact opposite of that right so like both the dictator and the world water cooler are actually not in full pluralism and so like actually figuring out like how do we get optimize for infop pluralism which basically means both pluralism existing and at the same time the the the interaction between the different groups like actually being not just competitive but also probably I think you know you don't want like fumay you want like some kind of healthy mixture of like competitive and and Cooperative then yeah you know like that's something how do we beat how do we beat the info Leviathan of of China and Russia the answer is we hide from it that it is very powerful in the town square and and rules the Town Square so we go to our houses and talk in Whispers to each other where the the monster cannot get us well there's this uh famous um I think uh infographic or comic or whatever you call it that got that was in a s store Cod X poost I think it was actually the one on community diis and civilization where basically yeah you know someone starts off making a garden and then the garden expands and then the garden expands and then the fence kind of eventually stretches out across the entire world and then at some point you basically you know the garden becomes the new reality and yeah so I think I'm not advocating for kind of like people constantly like playing cat and mouse games and spending a lot of energy running I'm basically advocating for developing the tools to make the internet landscape one that actually is um friendly to multiple um you know groups that are not Hans that actually are able to and like and where the the actual incentives align for them to interact in ways that are more productive and like me I think know if there's like you can never get 100% of the way there right and you know there will always be there to like say crazy things and fight Zero Sum games against other people who are saying the opposite crazy thing but like you can clearly go much further than zero right like I think again like the you know the world water cooler is kind of uh is probably the closest to zero that we can have and then the question is like well I mean even like if you look at you know the early internet um architecture right where you you know you had a lot of blogs you had a lot of forums and it did not look like anyone running and hiding from a single main thing but you know it did look like something that produced a lot of productive output right that's a great Point what what we're really running and hiding from is maybe the inefficiency of centralized information marketplaces uh rather than the fact that Russia and China are in there trying to do their thing right I think uh I mean ultimately you know if uh if I if an info ecosystem has a mechanism by which it's like vulnerable to Russia then it's like also going to be vulnerable to Elon Musk right and it's also going to be vulnerable to the Democratic party and it's also going to be vulnerable to the Republican party so I mean to a lesser extent because you do have kind of you do have more Avenues to uh like kind of push on those actors to be nicer but like to some extent still right and so I think you know there's in extents to which the those two things are similar problems and like to me the the ideal outcome is actually yeah you know like having like is not having you know healthy info ecosystems in a particular subset of countries that we label liberal democracies and then they can prosper and everyone else you know goes to dust like the ideal outcome is like you know the uh the world becomes a healthy information ecosystem right where um you know all of these like a pretty wide diversity of different actors can participate which inevitably means some that have you know quite crappy intentions but we still figure out how to muddle through and makes make that work reasonably well so here's my question is there any way you guys are uh you know and I have to go fairly soon here um but um my question is you guys are are all fans of blockchain of course and so maybe blockchain can can help here because maybe so Americans don't necessarily need blockchain to talk to each other like because I know there's there's forecast or whatever but like um like but maybe Chinese people do or or Russians maybe there are ways to to completely secretly talk to uh for people to completely secretly talk to each other uh so obviously you can use signal to just do encrypted but then someone can like maybe raid the office of signal or or maybe um you know kill anyone who signal on their phones I don't know you can do that but but maybe are are there ways technologically for blockchains to help Chinese people talk to other Chinese people about what they don't like about Xi Jinping and for Russian people to talk to other Russian people about what they don't like about Putin etc etc um have you no I have you seen Freedom tool no um it's um this interesting group it's this company made I think based out of Kiev and they have like people from a bunch of EX Soviet countries and the company is called Rao and they built this thing called Freedom tool it's with I believe it was a like  Riot connected lawyer Mark Fagan and basically what it says is if you have a Russian passport then you can digitally prove using I know like zero knowledge proof technology that have that you're a Russian citizen without revealing which one you are um and then you can just like go and partic basically participate in an online vote and the results of the online vote are like visible and they're guaranteed to be tamper proof right so basically it is an know Anonymous voting system that is like that basically lets us you know have like Shadow votes among the you know Shadow Russian nation and like actually at least you know create consensus of like you know what do Russian people actually think and so it's I thought that like it's it's very clearly this kind of like version one beta thing in a lot of ways right but uh it's I think interesting because uh like to me one of the like one of the big um you know like debates that you sometimes get around the discussion of like internet anonymity is basically like either you're uh or like the 1990s idea is like Freedom comes from the fact that on the internet nobody knows you're a dog right but then you have this debate of like oh well you know either you're verified but then if you're verified people know who you are they can go after you or you're anonymous but if you're anonymous and like no one has any need to trust you and like these days it's pretty much impossible for you to distinguish yourself from a bot right um and so the question is like can we actually solve both of those two things at the same time right and like can we have like strong privacy and at the same time like various forms of trustworthiness whatever that means in a particular concept and like have those things together right and like it actually feels like this current batch of you know zero knowledge proof technology and there's a couple of V blockchain use cases in there too um especially for I know like making these votes like censorship resistant um like it feels like that things like actually manages to solve both of those problems right and so the the frontier for creating a um you know an infosphere that is at least guarded against you know shall we say both you know centralized and know decentralized cyber attacks is like actually better than ever in some ways right so I think it's a yeah in this way it's an exciting time right and we actually yeah know get to see some of these things go live and see how they work so uh there's there's a partial answer for you there there no we're we're making some progress on on that front um guys this has been a fantastic conversation I've really enjoyed to kind of the interplay between uh the two of you I I guess as we sort of bookend this um maybe I I'll read a quote so even if your thesis is Right Noah you still think it's a it's a good idea to continue fighting for Liberal democracy you say this we should continue fighting for Liberal democracy and hope that technology and human nature allow for its continued victory maybe that's a place to to end this episode and uh we appreciate both your time thanks so much Ric muted himself but I'm sure he's saying thanks as well I think he is as well thanish Nation we will include a link to no's article that we discussed throughout the duration of today's episodes called how liberal democracy might lose we of course hope it doesn't and we are betting that crypto is part of the solution and part of the reason why it does not lose of course got to remind you even though we didn't discuss crypto today uh it is risky none of this has been Financial advice you could lose what you put in but we are headed west this is the frontier it's not for everyone but we're glad you're with us on the bankless journey thanks a lot econ 102 is a podcast from turpentine the network behind Moment of Zen in the arena the cognitive Revolution and more if you like what you hear subscribe and leave us the review in the App Store you can keep up with both of our substacks for in analysis of the topics we cover in the show at Noah opinion. substack do.com

    "title": "Vitalik Buterin On Death",
    "content": "get there I think what it hangs on the topic of whether we can convert Consciousness into an engineering problem so is consciousness tied to our biology because the moment we can convert Consciousness into a digital form then we can send it with that light sail to Alice centari until then a robot is not carrying anything except maybe some basic knowledge like Wikipedia it's not carrying the flame of human consciousness I have high hopes for converting Consciousness into engineering problem in fact I think it's not as difficult as people think I'm I I agree with that I'm definitely in the camp that like Consciousness is a property of the algorithm and not a property of brain structure um the other fun like the kind philosophical things we'd have to grapp Grapple with is like once you upload yourself like you can hit control C you know like it would be wouldn't it be lovely to have like 10 copies of Alex fedman and then like we could just interview everyone so this is I mean this is I I have to ask this question it's a difficult one which I don't think it' be wonderful first of all um sure so in the following way and this has to do with immortality as well there's something about scarcity that creates value or um there's a bunch of philosophers Victor Franco Bernard Williams Ernest Becker they argue that death or the scarcity of Life creates meaning that the reason we Life is Beautiful the reason in so many moments of experience of uh of Love or delicious food all those things are made delicious because they're finite because they end and because we don't have that many of them and there's a kind of worry that if we extend the human lifespan if we achieve immortality or if we God forbid clone uh me multiple times then you lose the richness of what it means to have this life to have this experience is that worry you at all do you think there's some aspect to which death does in fact give meaning to life I guess like the one historical parallel and like this might be a bit unfair is that you know there have been philosophers that said that have said things like you know War gives like meaning to human collectives and the struggle for Supremacy between you know Nations and races as this like Big Driver of progress that like that ensures that that everyone strives to be their best and um you know of course uh this view point got into the head of a crazy Austrian guy and 20 years later his soldiers were shooting at my grandparents um so you know these days we don't really have that but yet life still feels meaningful there's we've still found other ways to uh or the like there's still a striving for technological progress there's still um you know a a striving for self-improvement in general and it turns out that you know you don't need to have existential conflicts in order to in order to have that now maybe you need conflict but we have other kinds of conflict right like we have you know competition between businesses competition between political ideologies competition between projects and so you know these are like what what whatever the psychological needs are like they're just our substitutes for it so I guess like yeah so if we trying to say I I feel like once we start living to two to the age of 200 like I'm just intuitively expecting that we'll see sub like substitutes emerge in the same way yeah that we will'll create conflicts of other sorts that lead to less human suffering than Wars do like it we we'll just start playing Diablo 4 5 six and because you die in video games so maybe we'll get some of the inkling of scarcity through the activities we partake in as opposed to our own body dying I mean I feel shitty when I uh like you can the I remember in Diablo I you can play in hardcore mode where if you die in the game your character is dead so maybe we'll get the the richness of like what that we currently get from Life by having like little artificial versions of ourselves that die interestingly enough as I've just like personally spent more time in this world I've started realizing that you know there is a concept of like real fight finiteness that still like exists and it might even still a thing that provides meaning that doesn't requ anyone to actually die like for example like how many people from middle school or even high school or yours like do you still talk to regularly I'm happen to be close friends with like four or five of them okay like in my case the answer is zero for middle school and two for high school you're right it it dropped exactly it dropped a lot right and so like there's a lot of these just like relationships that end up being very finite um a person changes their I feel like a person changes enough of their worldview after 25 years wasn't there even a study about this something like a person and themselves 25 years later are about as different as like two different PE uh people or something like this um so yeah like I mean just like you can have conflict without Bloodshed I think um you know you you can have finiteness and even you know the necessary Sorrows of finiteness that give meaning without like literally any anyone having to end their life and hopefully if we do extend our life will figure out ways to extend the period of time where there's neuro neuroplasticity yes to where we could change our World Views continually throughout that time so you can have these different phases of life",

    "title": "Vitalik Buterin On Bitcoin Vs Ethereum",
    "content": "let me ask uh perhaps a strange question but uh you know proponents of Bitcoin will say uh things like Bitcoin fixes everything so why do we need ethereum uh versus like Bitcoin plus lightning Network for scalability uh and then using Bitcoin for with its proof of work for security so in this kind of um it is perhaps sort of a strange question but it's a high level question why do we need need another technology yes it has a bunch of nice features but like doesn't Bitcoin fix everything already so the thing that always attracted me about Bitcoin is you know these values of you know decentralization creating these open permissionless systems that anyone can participate in and that aren't just going to flop over and die if whoever created them gets bored and like that are resistance to like whoever runs them breaking the rules and all of these things right and I think that pretty strongly that these principles are like really valid and importance to much more things than just money right like Bitcoin is the blockchain for money and ethereum is built from the start as a a general purpose blockchain right it's you know there is ether the asset on ethereum but then you can also make you know decentralized Financial things what we call defi today um you know you can make like ens the decentralized domain name system um you can put make prediction markets on it it you can make totally non-financial systems that just like keep track of whether or not some certificate was signed or whether or not some like cryptographic key got revoked there's this big long list of like just interesting things that you could use blockchains to do right like basically they are sort of the missing piece that um where without them the kinds of things that a decentralized computer network can do is very limited and once you have them you know a lot of those limitations end up going away uh and so ethereum was like always from the beginning about that right it's about like hey this isn't just money this is there's so much more that you could do if you could just go ahead and make any infrastructure or you know digital institution or Dow or whatever you want to call it where you the kind of the base layer of the logic is just executed in this open and transparent way where everyone can see what's going on or you know if you like your zer proof at least everyone can see proofs that prove to you that what's going follows the rules and you you don't need to like just constantly keep trusting centralized actors and hence the smart contracts exact as being a sort of a core technology as part of ethereum yes exactly smart contracts the computer programs that are running on ethereum they are like the core of what makes ethereum general purpose yeah um so I think like I do think that you know there's a lot more that wrong with the world than just money right like I'm not one of these people who thinks that you know if you get rid of fiat currency and you replace it with cryptocurrency then suddenly Wars are going to go away right because like first of all um you know like soraj revenue is only a small portion of government revenue right it's like what 5 10% something like that second of all like if you are the sort of um this is one of the things I don't even get about their philosophy like let's say you're the sort of person who is a like an extrem very distrusting libertarian and you think that these governments are terrible right like we we know today that governments find a combination of uh you know things like welfare and things like you know the military that um you know goes and like bombs people in Afghanistan right and the so the question you have to ask is like okay you um with your new um you know ma magic new fangle Cyber currency that takes over the world take away the government's ability to to have sen res and so you reduce the government's Revenue by 10% if the government is that evil which portion of its um expenses is it going to take that 10% from is it going to stop the bombing people in Afghanistan or is it going to cut welfare if you think it's the first you have a very optimistic view of the government right so that's I guess my perspective on like why the whole um you know we're going to save the world and create and create peace by like denying government's the right to stealth taxation kind of perspective doesn't really make much sense for me and I do think that there is real value that comes from a decentralized an open currency like just the fact that there is a financial infrastructure that anyone in the world can you know go ahead and use right like it's a that's something that can easily be a Big Boon for people right there's a lot of places where the currency and is much less stable than the dollar and you know people like they don't like well if they use Bitcoin their only option is to get Bitcoins right which you know are also pretty volatile um if they use ethereum then you know they can get ether but then they can also get stable coins right and you might think that you know oh you're not being ideologically pure now you're giving them stable coins which are mirroring dollars and obviously dollars are going to collapse too but the reality is that dollars are vastly more stable than the Venezuelan bolar uh so like there are really like meaningful and beneficial things that you can give to People by create having a global and open Financial system but I think if you want to actually do that like you have to have much more than just a currency right and then if you want to go beyond Financial things then you know you have to obviously have much more than a currency and then you know you also have to actually take scalability seriously because the non-financial applications like nobody's going to pay $5 a transaction for them",

    "content": "like um first know there was the split with Bitcoin cash and then of course Craig Wright came in and you know Craig Wright was uh this basically scammer who just keeps on pretending that he is SOS Nakamoto the inventor of Bitcoin hey Craig W's legal team do you hear me yes I still think your client is a scammer so sue me this is definitely going to be depth for a search because I got to ask you about great I because his people have been contacting me and I'm trying to figure out like what is up with this human being so for people who don't know there's somebody who is let's start there's Satoshi Nakamoto who is the creator of Bitcoin who's Anonymous and actually most really big people in the cryptocurrency space do not like like yourself and others do not dare claim that they are even for fun satosi nakoto in fact if Satoshi nakoto is still alive and is like if say you were a SAT kodo it seems like the thing he would do is probably or she is uh try to remain anonymous on the flip side of that there's a guy named Craig Wright who continually keeps claiming that he is in fact satos Nakamoto and keeps suing a lot of people so uh on on him if you could just Linger on him what do you make of this character uh what what are we supposed to make of this character should he be ignored is there any possible truth to his claims um what do you make of him the analogy that's at the at the top of my head will get a bit political but um that's fine you've had Michael ballis um so I guess I view Craig Wright as being kind of like a Donald Trump figure yes in that like he's not very intellectual um but I think he gets a big audience because he says he he says things that like play to the resentments that people have and he says things that uh people want to hear right like in the in the wake of this black siiz War know the big blockers did feel very disenchanted like they felt that you know Bitcoin always had this Vision that we were supposed to just keep increasing the block size and Bitcoin is pure to pure cash it says so in the white paper and then this this elitist cck of Cavs just like came in and said you know no no no we're going to impose this totally different vision and if you ever want your scalability you'll have to wait for us to create this this totally unproven fancy technology called the lightning Network that works under completely different principles and you know they were very angry at this and I mean I think like I think a lot of that anger is Justified um but at the same time you know when people are in that mental state like it's very easy for you to just kind of like latch on and if you find someone who expresses anger at the same things that you're angry at and also like seems like someone who's strong and seems like someone who you know might be good to Rally around it's very easy to just like get behind that but that extra part about where he's I don't understand why that's necessary I think that's um he could have done it without that but that I mean that just it's a marketing strategy like it sort of gives him more salience like there's other big block personalities right well what's the difference between with Greg right he's not just a big a big block personality he's potentially Satoshi um and he did say all the big block things right like he talked about how oh the concept of a fee Market is fundamentally like economically wrong and it should be it should be a free market and you should be able to have blocks as big as you want like he repeated all the talking points and so a lot of people were kind of stucked into that right and so he unfortunately was able to basically dominate a big part of the Bitcoin cash Community for a long time and then eventually of course um you know more and more people started to catch on um he would just say technical things that are completely wrong right like one example of this that I um remember is that he mixed up the concept of 256 bits and two to the of 256 bits right um so you know the difference is it's like the difference between you know 80 and the concept of 80 digit numbers right um and because of this like he made this made this argument that said that Bitcoin that bitcoin's elliptic curve is friendly to cryptographic pairings like you don't have to understand what that is but if you want to know I have articles on both at metallic. CA um but but basically he made this like technical argument that really hedged on this point and then when when people pressed them on it is like yes what no no like what look exactly the the height is like what two two to the 256 bits that's a very uh a very tiny amount of information no no no no two 2 256 bits is more than the amount of information in the universe and like he you know equivocated and kind of like prayed on people's inability to know understand that mathematical nuance and I called him out and eventually I even called him out in person at this conference and St like I just stood up and the you know hey you know conference organizer why are you letting this fraud speak at this conference and I remember even some big blockers at the time getting angry at me um but you know eventually they did get rid of him and then Craig well basically Craig Wright um was forced to split off because the rest of the community refused to accept some Network change that he wanted and so then there was the bch and bsv and then in the Bitcoin cash Community there was this drama of are they going to add a developer fund where they redirect 12 a half% of the revenue from the miners to the devs and according to the libertarian do aggression principle is this technically theft um like his um understanding of the technical depths of cryptocurrency was lacking in a way that you satosi certainly would not yes exactly but the point is like even after Craig Wright got expunged the Bitcoin cash Community kept having these disagreements right and now after this uh development funds dispute there there was a further split between Bitcoin cash and ABC so you know the the bran tree continues to extend right so so in that way it's disappointing to see those kinds of splitting that was never resolved it is I would have definitely like wanted to see more of a kind of like principled coin with a that like tries to be Bitcoin but F but you know follows consistent big block values but I don't know maybe I should just like stop expecting projects that I have no involvement and to care at all about what my values are and you know like maybe ethereum just like is I think you have a powerful voice and you can Inspire other projects to do to to live up to their best possible",

    "title": "Vitalik Buterin Beginner Guide To Crypto",
    "content": "mhm so if we could can we go to the the very basic what is the blockchain or perhaps we might even start at the uh the Byzantine General's problem and Byzantine fall tolerance in general that I I uh Bitcoin was taking steps to uh providing a solution for so the Byzantine General's problem it's this uh paper that Leslie Lamport published in 1982 where he has a St experiment where if you have two generals that are of camped out on opposite sides of a city um and they're planning when to attack the city then uh the question is and if how could those generals coordinate with each other and they could send me Messengers between each other but those Messengers kind of could get sniped by the enemy on the road road uh some of those messages could end up being traitors and things could end up happening and with just two uh mess generals it turns out that there's kind of no solution in a finite number of rounds that guarantees that they will be able to of coordinate on the same answer um but then in the case where you have more than two generals and then Les analyzes cases like um are the mess messages kind of just oral messages um are the messages kind of signed m messages so I can give you a a signed message and then you can pass along that signed message and the third party can still verify that I originally made that message and depending on those different cases there's kind of different bounds on like given how many generals and how many Traders among those generals and if what like under what conditions you actually can agree once to launch an attack uh so it's actually a big misconception that the the bus General's problem was unsolved so Les Lamport solved it the thing that was unsolved though is that all of these Solutions assume that you've already agreed on kind of a fixed list of who the generals are and these generals have to be kind of semi-trusted to some extent they can't just be anonymous people because if they're Anonymous then like the enemy could just be 99% of the generals uh so right the um in the 1980s and the 1990s of the general use case for distributed system stuff was more kind of enterpris stuff where you could kind of assume that uh you know you know who the nodes are that are running these computer networks so if he wants to have some of decentralized computer network that pretends to be a single computer and that you can kind of do do of operations on then it's made out of these of 15 specific computers and we know kind of who and where they are and so we have a good reason to believe that say at least 11 of them would be fine and it it could also be within a single system almost like almost a network of devices sensors so on like in airplanes and I think uh like flight systems in general still use these kinds of ideas yep yep um so so that's the 80s that's the 80s and '90s now the cipher punks had a different use case in mind which is that they wanted to create a fully decentralized Global permissionless Currency and the problem here is that they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want any kind of privileged list of people right and so now the question is well how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of measuring identities right you have no way of kind of determining whether or not some 99% of participants aren't actually all the same guy and so the clever solution that Satoshi had this is uh kind of going back to the that presentation I made at Defcon a few months ago where I said that the thing Satoshi invented was crypto economics um is this uh really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind of limit ident how many identities you can get and the uh if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency then the only way to do this is with proof of work right so with proof of work the solution is just uh you um publish a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle that takes some uh kind if clearly calculable amount of computational power to solve you get an identity and then you solve five of those puzzles you get five identities and then these are the identities that we run the consensus algorithm between so the proof of work mechanism you just described is like the fundamental idea proposed in the in the white paper that defines Bitcoin uh what's the idea of consensus that we wish to reach what why is consensus important here what is consensus so the goal here in just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wire together a set of a large number of computers in such a way that they kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single computer where that single computer keeps working even if a large port of the kind of constituents the computers that make it up break and kind of break in arbitrary ways like they could shut off they could try to actively break a system they could do lots of mean things so the um reason why the Cypher punks wanted to do this is because they wanted to run one particular program on this virtual computer and the one particular program that they wanted to run is just a currency system right it's a system that just processes a series of transactions and for every transaction it verifies uh that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction it verifies that the digital signature is correct and if the check's passed then it subtracts the coins from one account and adds the coins to the other account roughly so first of all the the the proof of work idea is kind of I mean at least to me seems pretty fascinating it is I mean that's a it's kind of a revolutionary idea I mean is is it is it obvious to come up with that you can use uh you can exchange basically computational resources for for identity mhm it's uh it actually has a pretty long history it was uh first proposed in a paper by uh M cythia dwar and neor in 1994 I believe and the original use case was combating email spam uh so the idea is that if you send an email you have to send it with a proof of work attached and like this makes it reasonably cheap to send emails to your friends but it makes it really expensive to send spam to a million people yeah that's a simple brilliant idea so maybe also taking a step back so what is the role of blockchain in this what is the blockchain sure so the blockchain my way of thinking about it is that it is this uh kind of system where you have this kind of one virtual computer created by just a bunch of these uh nodes in the network um and the reason reason why the term blockchain is used is because the data structure that these systems use at least so far is one where they um of different nodes in the network periodically publish blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions uh together with a pointer like a hash of a pre a previous block that it builds on top of um and so you have a a series of blocks that that nodes and then create where each block points to the previous block and so you have this chain of them is a fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of blockchain or is there a lot of possibilities of different ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on there are indeed a lot of possibilities um so in a kind of just simple architecture as I just described the way the fault tolerance happens is like this right so you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily kind of occasionally creating blocks building on top of each other blocks and let's say you have of one block we'll call it kind of block one and then someone else builds another block on a steel called block two then we have an attacker and what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries to revert block two and the way they revert block two is instead of doing the thing they're supposed to do which is build a block on top of block two they're going to build another block on top of block one um so you have block one which has two children block two and then block two prime now this might sometimes even happen by random chance if you know two nodes in the network just happen to create blocks at the same time and then it would hear about each other's things before they create their own but this also could happen because of an attack now if this happens you have an attack then the no in the Bitcoin system the nodes follow the longest chin um so if um this um attack had happened and when the original chain had more than two blocks on it so if it was trying to kind of revert more than more than two blocks then everyone would just would just ignore it um and everyone would just keep following the regular chain but here you know we have block two and we have block two Prime and so the two are kind of even and then whatever block um the next block is created on top of so say block three is now created on top of block two prime then everyone say agrees that block three is the new head um and block two prime is just kind of Forgotten and then everyone just kind of peacefully Builds on top of block three and then thing continues so how difficult is it to mess with the system I so how like if we look at the general problem like how many what fraction of people who participate in the system have to be bad players in order to mess with it truly like what's your is there is there a good number theas um well depending on kind of what your model of the participants is and like what kind of attack we're talking about it's anywhere between 23.2 and 50% of what of all of the computing power in the network sorry so 22 and 23 point between 23.2 and 50% and 50% are can be uh compromised so like once your once your P your portion of the total um computing power of the network goes above the 23.2 level then there's kind of things that you could mean things that you can potentially do and as your percentage of the network kind of keeps going up then the your ability to do mean things kind of goes higher and then if you have above 50% then you can just break everything so how how hard is it to achieve that level like it seems that so far historically speaking it's been exceptionally difficult so this is a challenging question um so the economic cost of uh a requiring that level of stuff from scratch is uh fairly High I think it's uh somewhere in the low billions of dollars and when you say that stuff you mean computational resources yeah so specifically specialized hardware and of as6 that people use to solve these puzzles to do the minding these days small small tangent uh so obviously I work a lot in deep learning with gpus and as6 for that application and I tangentially kind of hear that so many of these you know sometimes Nvidia gpus are sold out because of this other application like what do if you can comment I don't know if you're familiar or interested in the space what kind of as6 what kind of Hardware is generally used these days for to do the actual computation for the the proof of work sure so in the case of Bitcoin and ethereum are a bit different so in the case of Bitcoin there's an algorithm called shot 256 it's just a hash function and so the puzzle is just coming up with a number where the hash of the number is below some threshold and so because the hashes are designed to be random you just have to keep on trying different numbers until one works and the as6 are just like specialized circuits that contain and circuits for evaluating this hash over and over again and you have kind like millions or billions of these hash evaluators and just stacks on top of each other inside of a box and you just keep on running the Box 247 and the Asic there's literally specialized Hardware designed for this yes oh this is we live in an amazing world another tangent and I'll come back to the basics but uh does Quantum Computing throw a wrench into any of this very good question so quantum computers have two main of families of algorithms that are relevant to cryptography one is a shes algorithm and Shores algorithm is one that kind of completely breaks the hardness of some specific kinds of mathematical problems so the one that you've probably heard of is it makes it very easy to factor numbers so figure out kind of what prime factors are that kind of that you need to multiply together to get some number even if that number is extremely big um shes algorithm can also be used to break elliptic curve cryptography um it can break like any kind of hit and Order groups it it breaks a lot of kind of cryptographic nice things that we're used to but the good news is that for every kind of major use of things that chores algorithm breaks we already know of quantum proof Alternatives right now the we don't use these Quantum proof Alternatives yet because in many cases they're five to 10 times L efficient but and know the crypto industry in general kind of knows that this is coming eventually and it's s of ready to take the hit and switch to that stuff when we when we have to the second algorithm that is relevant to cryptography as Grover's algorithm and and Grover's algorithm might even be of more familiar to AI people that's basically usually described as solving search problems um but the idea here is that if you have a problem over the form find a number that satisfies some property um then if with a classical computer you need to try kind of end times before before you find a number then with a qu computer you only need to do square root of end computations and Grovers could potentially be used for mining but there's two possibilities here one is that Grovers could be used for mining and whoever creates the first working glom computer that could do Grovers will just mine way faster than everyone else and we'll see another round of uh what we saw when A6 came out which is that kind of the new hardware just kind of dominated the old stuff and then eventually switched to in your equilibrium but by the way way faster not exponentially faster quadratically faster quadratically faster which is not sort of uh it's not gamechanging I would say it's or like asex like you said it would be exactly yeah so it would not necessarily break proof of work as a thing that's right yeah now the other kind of possible world right is that quantum computers have a lot of overhead there's a lot of a complexity involved in maintaining Quantum States and there's also so as we've been realizing recently making quatum computers actually work requires kind of quatum mirror correction which requires kind of a thousand real cubits per logical Cubit and so there's the very real possibility that the overhead of running a quantum computer will be higher than the speed up you get with Grovers which would be kind of sad but which would also mean that like given proof of work will just keep working fine so beautifully put so so proof of work is uh the core idea of Bitcoin is there other core ideas before we kind of take a step towards the origin story and the ideas of ethereum is there other stuff that were key to the white paper of Bitcoin there's proof of work and then there's just the cryptography just kind of public keys and signatures that are used to verify transactions those two are the big things",

    "title": "vitalik interview",
    "content": "saw that the price just went up by a th% and I was like oh my God my doge is worth like a lot and so I immediately called up some of my friends and told them to like drop everything and scramble and I sold half the Doge and I got $4.3 million donated the proceeds to give directly and a few hours after I did this the price dropped back down from about 7 cents to 4 cents right so I managed to sell the Doge at the top and I remember just feeling like I was such an amazing Trader but then of course you know the price went up from 4 cents then to seven and then 50 and just like Doge becoming this big phenomenon where there's even a lot of people that have heard of Doge that have not heard of ethereum is just like something even I wasn't predicting right and so after that of course you know we have Doge and then people are thinking well you know if the leading dog token is worth $50 billion then surely the second largest dog token deserves you know at least seven or eight billion right like I feel like that's kind of what the mindset of these Sheba people is um so then of course they did this other gimmick right where they gave gave me half the Sheba token Supply um they were actually not the first projects to do this so around the end of 2020 there was this weird project called teller it's like t e l l o r I think they're a chain link competitor or something like this but I remember they just like dumped $50,000 worth of their token into my wallet and then they had their Twitter rby just like basically run around saying look look at vell's wallet vitalic holds tellers he's one of us he's a supporter and as soon as I discovered this I just like publicly sold the teller tokens on Unis Swap and this created a bit of a Twitter Splat now the Sheba people were more clever the Shea people instead of dumping to that wallet they dumped to my cold wallet right so in a cryptocurrency right there's this concept of like cold wallets and hot wallets basically like the thing that actually owns your money is like this 80 digigit number called a private key right and a hot wallet is when that private key is just stored in memory on on your computer on your phone really easy to access qu wallet means it's either on written down on a piece of paper or it's uh on a computer that's just never accessed the internet right so cold is very inconvenient but cold is also much more secure right because even if that computer has some like viruses on it like it's it's like air gapped it's not actually going to be able to upload it so this cold wallet and like all the money is out of the cold wallet so it's safe for me to talk about my setup now right but it was a laptop that was sitting in Canada and I also had um two pieces of paper where I wrote down two numbers on those two pieces of paper one was with me one was in Canada and if you add those two numbers together you get the private key so because of Co travel restrictions and you know this is this cold wallets in Canada like it's very difficult for me to um actually access it right and I'm not sure if they knew this maybe they just got lucky but B basically they you know sent a lot of these dog tokens into this wallet where I it was very difficult for me to access it but then I saw these dog Co tokens I saw more and more people talking about them and then at some point I real like realized that like hey these things are worth billions of dollars and like you know there's lots of really good things that you could do with that amount of money and it would actually be a waste to just like see it go so I made the decision that like I would actually power through and figure out how like safely like basically get my private key um I actually had to call up my family tell them to read out their number off of their piece of paper I uh entered that into a fresh laptop that I bought from Target then I put in my other uh number on my piece of paper added the two numbers together on the computer there's the key and at the same time like just scrambled for two days setting up a new wallet for to where I could move my e through safely like getting people to be multisig partners just like doing all sorts of like stuff that you know 10 years ago you would expect to just be part of a cyber punk you know science fiction novel but you know now it's all real so you're doing this all all by yourself essentially most of it by myself so I to keep it secret right and me I needed my family to um actually like go and read the the number on their piece of paper and then I um in my new multisig wallet like there's other people that are signatories um but you know I'm obviously not going to reveal any Det dets beond that so I did this right and I actually managed to like get the private key make the first transaction that would just move all my ether to the multisig wallet so it's safe and then second transa put the private key on my main computer then started you know like going in and just selling some of the dog tokens and then just like giving them to these different charities now at the time I actually did not even like H have any idea of how much you would be able to get",

Source in the dynamic world of digital assets read more about Crypton news micr strategy founder Michael sailor's recent recommendation that Bitcoin holders should trust large financial institutions for custody has sparked massive controversy within the cryptocurrency community sailor who once Champion the virtues of self- custody now argues that too big to fail Banks and investment firms are the IDE de custodians for Bitcoin this stance has drawn sharp criticism from ethereum co-founder vitalik but Aron who labeled the suggestion insane he argues that it does not align with the future of bitcoin's decentralized Nature Michael sailor's shift from Bitcoin self- custody to institutional custodianship beran's comments were triggered by an October 22nd post from Casa's Chief security officer Jameson Lop the ethereum co-founder argued that sailor advocacy for centralized institutions like Black Rock and Fidelity to handle Bitcoin custody is antithetical to cryptocurrency ethos there's plenty of precedent for how this strategy can fail and for me it's not what crypto is about in the aftermath of the FTX collapse in late 2022 sailor claimed that self- custody was a Cornerstone of maintaining bitcoin's decentralized Network at the time he argued that the risk of centralization and abuse by custodians would rise dramatically without the ability of individuals to hold their own Bitcoin if you can't self- custody your coin there's no way to establish a decentralized network however during an interview on October 21st sailor took a marketly different position when asked about the possibility of the US government seizing Bitcoin from holders like gold confiscation in 1933 sailor dismissed such concerns as paranoid crypto Anarchist thinking he argued that large financial institutions already experienced in asset custodianship are better suited to safeguard Bitcoin than individual users relying on Hardware wallets critics were quick to point out sailor inconsistency John carvalo CEO of Bitcoin payments firm synonym expressed disappointment in Sailor change of heart particularly given the executives earlier claims that Bitcoin is hope for individuals seeking Financial sovereignty Simon Dixon author of bank to the Future suggested that sailor shift was part of micro strategy's long-term strategy to eventually offer collateralized loans using Bitcoin thereby positioning itself as a central player in bitcoin's custodianship the importance of self- custody in bitcoin's decentralized ecosystem but Aaron and other prominent figures like Jameson Lop have pointed out the dangers inherent in Sailor Pro institution stance they argue that self- custody is not merely a personal choice but a fundamental aspect of bitcoin's decentralized architecture Lop lists the risks of centralizing Bitcoin ownership within a few large financial institutions in his post he warned that such concentration of power could lead to the same systemic risks that Bitcoin was designed to avoid including asset seizure and custodian misuse for but Aaron sailor suggestion that Bitcoin should be housed in institutions engineered to be financial asset custodians undermines cryptocurrencies decentralized promise Sailors approach risks regulatory capture but Aaron warned that entrusting Bitcoin to institutions invested by lawmakers and Regulators could ultimately weaken bitcoin's ability to operate outside the conventional Financial system he argued that this goes against the very ethos of cryptocurrency which is to offer individuals Financial independence without Reliance on centralized intermediaries despite the Uproar some defend sailor position suggesting it targets institutions more than individual users Julian Figaroa founder of get based noted that while self- custody may be viable for individuals and small businesses larger institutions with hundreds of employees would inevitably need to rely on custodians even so the broader

    "content": "hello everyone and welcome to the web three cm1 Stories podcast my name is Yuri Bast and I'm your podcast host and today I'm so excited to be joined by Anna Anna how are you yeah hello jury thank you for having me here great to see you I'm great and excited about the second day of European blockchain convention in Barcelona absolutely we are in Barcelona guys again another amazing conference and so excited to left Anna on the show but if you're are wondering who is Anna if you don't know her lots of you will probably already have seen or heard about her she is a public speaker a fortune media contributor and CEO of coin teleground crypto Media Group and Consulting agency and furthermore Anna is a co-producer of the documentary film decentralized no matter what on the new era of digital economy you had such a big bu you did already so amazing things but let's go to the beginning I I'm curious to hear from you what initially sparked your interest in the web Tre and crypto space and how did your background in international law influence this thank you for such nice introduction and uh generally like you ask about myground in international law I knew about Bitcoin first who internship love company which deals as well the SCP in blockchain it was uh back in 2017 he went in Bitcoin in conversation with me I got interested I started Googling with that and generally before I've been always interested to multiply my assets and to invest my S somewhere and uh before that I usually just had deposits in Ukrainian Banks so I got some interests from my deposits and as well like that so was everywhere advertis lot of Forex Market Forex Trading I went to some Forex seminars but I didn't understand the SM trading so uh eventually I didn't invest into Forex or STS or anything like that uh but I invested into crypto and until now it's only investment plus I have and all the financial ass I invest in uh so first I got to to know about Bitcoin back 2020 I wanted to invest into it but it was trading at around $2,000 but unfortunately I thought about that to my parents so they started shouting at me and I didn't M us and then in some time in the cof year and you saw all the guys they started working this one IO project when they invited me for the interview and since I already had some basic knowledge about crypto started back in the desert and as well time since O7 I startled in cryp uh first of all it was initially from just po side just the to draw my savings and to multiply them so I invest start water preure but been always interested in new technologies in different Innovations and this industry is so open and so exciting so much happening and it's rapidly growing so I'm not tooed wow and now today you're here at the European blockchain convention and you are a speaker you have been spoke you have been speaking of difference conferences around the world so then I'm curious what did you learn from that but because it's different Visions about their Vision on on the crypto space and what's happening ah yes uh we can see as well the ships of kind in the different crypto capitals so when I began I think it was all about Asia I used to go so so many times to Asia to conferences in Hong Kong in Singapore even to China before China VOR so it was interesting and it felt like the center of all the crypto was in Asia but as well in the yes too there was a lot of happening there and currently we are in Europe and finally Europe is as well coming up given us the face and we see as well Europe currently with Mika one of the most advanced regulations who crypto here in Europe uh but we can see as well some differences for but in Asia we can see War Walk in Europe it falls to be a l corporate Financial Focus PL so we see adoption effect on More by blockchain by Enterprises I different B and financial even if we talk specifically about this conference M motion convention and as well I should know that I'm Bas currently in the Bary in the Middle East and the buy as well has become a real crypto capital and everybody is moving there because because of Z taxes for the personal gains and as well because so much happening there reg is super friendly and welcoming as there are different zes different Regulators like for example abav Global loc Market ad G or for examp assets andat Authority launched theid dedicated zone for the crypto startup that's Wi on real company there and Community from all over the world ising to and it feels like the center of everything and beside that ially from Ukraine so Ukraine is as well one of the top countries in the adoption of crypto this year it's on the number six Lobel cry index by CH analysis of the C adoption before it was few years ago you was the first place because back then we had more than of migration in crypto I guess this number is even began especially we we have unfortunate conditions with the B but the bo is well showed how the cral cries can be as well Bly such conditions to move their assets gross is when they flee a country Ro the war and as well LEL new our community helps Ukraine visiting ASAS Ukraine 100 crypto crypto delicious wow yeah you see all the advantages what wishes that crypto can offer I had one of the earlier podcast episodes I also youan lady she came on and she she was you know taking you know going over there in business while you know it's a difficult situation it's really Brave I had also people from circle on the podcast how they explain what they are doing how they want to help places where it's not easy to transfer money another project I know about which is in Japan the Rio coin now they are launching they want to be crypto for the masses and uh but the challenge that they have there is that it's so regulated there are so many rules so yeah what are your thoughts about the regulations more specifically maybe in the Asian countries oh so Asian countries are one of the most of that still of the crypto too and I would say all AB has started in Asia most there the majority of exchanges are originally from Asia from China or a lot of them located to Singapore as well obviously the biggest trading community in Korea and as well Jaan in Asia was one of the first which noted and to legalized crypto they recognized cry as CL and up specifically about uh Bank we see is all the prime minister who step on no down from the stage is talking about the crypto crypto and this to go to Jaan we can see as long different differences between the countries and prob most of Asia is currently coning with C relations well before that it used to be Singapore singap is still wi great jurisdiction but they became quite stringent after the class of Ft because their so ft they were considering to as a crypto startups but after the crash of APS and they became much more careful so the environments and reol are much much fun and things this year to get license quite time process but I just came now s for toen for9 the larest Crypt and how much is happening yeah it's just a different feeling like I've been speaking on conferences in Asia itself but online I did and it's a different atmosphere yeah it's not like countries like Indonesia Vietnam is not the top of chain syst Krypto top adoption yeah have so many uses what I special is about to re story is that the holders of the coin are more people like in their 50s 60s 7s which you won't see elsewhere in the world like maybe typically for Japan is that surprising for you or uh uh generally yes because we adjusted that it's usually young gener are more open to different generations and to Glass usually senior generation they just just to invest into stocks real estate to into stable acids bones and not crypto because Krypto is so volatile so it's surpris but I feel the same about that in Australia sen generation is yeah so interesting all these differences but what also intrigues me is the documentary that you created you work you know it features people like falic Cy and I'm curious what were most of the let's say surprising or maybe insightful moments that you encountered where you were co-producing the documentary so do want to know what about maybe you can because our listeners what maybe they haven't seen it yet maybe you can first say what is about and maybe there's something a surprising moment or an exciting moment that you remember from producing it yeah so we produced already to do I started the business experiment in El obious started killing in back in 2021 in the world 2021 I it was quite funny like just SP for holiday in Mexico and then it turned out that there would be a conference Ator Andor what time adopted Bitcoin is ISC as a legal tender so that mean just to yeah the idea maybe FL called to fil this L of with those countes of all adopting Bitcoin as a legal center so we just got to and sing man to started F the story ofcoin confy and the president the vice president the of the parament and uh o Founders and BR be and Etc so the least it'sa on our YouTube channel we have it as well on our YouTube channel it's because I started Living in theing the time and a lot of people started moving to the B col times so they started as well later in1 like we have justo and just s influences that the movie is mostly focused on the history and value of the co and you can watch it as well on our YouTube channel who made uh some uh presentations and B screenings in Dubai and mono during for one in and currently weish this our bigb documentary and did see even one well some new top leaders of the stre like cre profitable col company in cryp now as well we have his confounder mck ma cently she manages with family office M as well we have J sh walk bigest gaming and the most fun and as well we help make all this to and happy to have you allier on 2 over in so wow shine will be cutting out public so we got to do some EV conf you can watch channel to wow it's amazing everything that you're doing so Anna you mentioned some amazing names you know big names in in the crypto space then I'm curious what maybe was one or more takeaways that you got from Meeting those people talking to those people I yeah I had a chance to read all those only adopted on crypto and it's back fascinating because startled not for from the speculation quite a few but like a lot of people for specific like especially very back 201 when was like all the said it was and and just believe in this idea that one day it become like very weak just receiv re andina lot of space of like lot of them didn't lach over from South without he just started right some go one with so Anna yeah it's it's inspiring talking to you and I'm wondering now there are a lot of challenges if if you are an entrepreneur or a business own and you want to do Stu in web 3 space let me first ask you that what are some of the challenges that you're seeing and then after that of course what can we do you know to solve the challenges I get seeing there specifically in my case in yeah uh we see so many VI news currently and so they been just like almost every R so Happ in the world and it's really hard to keep up this our industry and that world even the crypto industry overall feels like all for example you but it feels like to yes that it's hard face we all that's happening we witness it and was we to have Z first and challenge because we see such of lot information people just likeing some just somewhere and the five see the te we one the social people because you got and got all the news in real time and really quick not and to just grab titles or just the headlines of what both and as well like the the side of the challeng is and to people CH allation overloads of course is there but for we also is a challenge that people when they see news can they trust the news you know because saw fake because everybody want to be b or so they and then sometimes if somebody in that organization didn't song may I to it I'm smiling a bit because there is so so much noise around us that you really feel the pipes of these events but yeah that this is a challenge scams are a challenge people need to be careful what what they believe what they don't believe now looking into the the same is everybody saws that it's incredible color and S like Tai investors m c so it gives a lot of credibility okay is good guys they this exchange so it should be trustable but in reality ising use cust FS yeah and and now with AI there are so many possibilities uh a lot of deep fix yeah a lot of deep fixs and also or or identities that have compet and then now that's another discussion digital identities is that something that you are following while is that because sand from stop domains was on my podcast to talk about that already a few times do we have a vision about that or an or opinion about digital identities well well I guess company identi space is quiet when or so some people as well some presal and that I can I my but people who don't have because of people like identity as and blockchain can be a real solution absolutely absolutely do you see if you now looking in the next years because a lot of things happen already you said in one maybe let's say one year further how positive are you about the space and what Evolutions do you see if you can see like you know in the future well yeah g are quite optimist about this a and they can make to dire One Direction is fundamental soal development and real adoption of watch and kryon and scientist how the market tributing to it so basically we see some advancements who technology but be done for the currently is mar okay like this R cut is yes so of course Market reacted a bit so they are coming back with the crypto part Bitcoin is so they deal was $64,000 but on out side it's but yet the super cycle like it's so 20 21 2022 so I guess everybody supect toting all those all car on like crazy what it's a fashion of the get the because EV and checks to people and one that's currently I feel like L depends in the outcome of the elections in the so I guess most parties will have to eras so whole crypto and as well to keep us the leader over all to the district by might been more beneficial for our industry see we drifted the but we see from the technology that like industry because and well see where the appearance of so many new companies realization of some old ideas like because going into salinization conferences back since 3 and that time the a representatives of the b b came to those SP but first F who extent of just investing up every and currently we see if by any all those bands are embracing blockchain and technology and uh talization we see a lot of interesting um uh toiz invest treasuries and as Securities and still this uh industry is pretty all we see 3 billion uh dollars still tokenized as SM is projected to to Dos not L CL the C of nrog just stting from the TV andol Bitcoin and conization so it's quite a colation of our industry and I see is the shift of distri like sou wall is all from the side of investor S as well he the rest of people the see know some deing startups so would as well lot of a lot of people like phys mathematician in the industry too and they have been not into character at all in just and made those big projects big traditional Communications called e but we sings of oning jazz F and the community which has some incentivization everybody just Des some section some real so that's pretty to and of course for me personally specific I see adoption on the side of the crypto and um so already around was than 60% of noes we to then already see 88 people holding it's like a with Years Years 800 people holding F down isus almost estimated and like from because those people just want to get some drops Co and they just play those St games but people and change so now it's like a stupid IDE s St games mod some it brings an option to so that's biggest any yeah yeah so lots of possibilities lots of things now crypto for a lot of people is still like a black box yeah so if you talk to others and they you know they are not really understanding or they are interested in web three and they want to dive in what is some of advice that you give those people well read our website telegram.com follow J I guess you have youngest yeah as well like if you want to be m in crypto to have a Twitter is Master it's the source of all the news or like currently if you want to know all the basics you can just Google ad like what's with what's like with how to my crypto as well we see some other tools like CH with AI or like black City you can ask all question what to do and you can get the answers and get dedicated and should watch so educational videos as well be so to this website I don't really of commments to read books sometimes they good but in know industry they be completely outdated but just if you want to know like B the history of the agob all like C idea adoption Cas blockchain well with Cod number our industry so wellow those are great tips gr great resources as my followers know my listeners they always show notes you can find all the links in there that Anna mentioned if there is something else you want to add an is there a profile on social media where people can follow you yeah I'm on link on as well Twitter the same name you can check our YouTube channel white cpon so you can find me there and well can find me at the conferences and conferences and as well different side events is as well one of the best ways to S and as well to talk for already the and housing space to come to the conferences and to network with the people in the best of absolutely that's how we met also an as I said there will be show notes all links everything will be in there for people that want to more know about you how to find you is what yeah it was such a pleasure to have you on the podcast yeah pleasure to be on podcast thank you for guys what an amazing podcast here at the European blockchain convention in Barcelona actually this is such a great podcast episode this must be useful for people around you that are not yet in a crypto space feel free to share the episode talk also about everything that Anna is doing as I said the links are in the show notes and of course if you are not subscribed to the show as I always say this is a really good moment to do this if you haven't given me a review yet please do that because it helps me reach even more people and of course I would like to see you back next time take care bye-bye",

leading to the creation of [Music] ethereum there's a good ways to do it and there's bad ways to do it the biggest risk of being friendly is if you end up like attracting the terrible people right like the thing with the crypto space is that it's very high variant and the problem is that if you get a certain kind of reputation it's like very easy to accidentally attract all of the Duke ones in 2013 19y old metallic butterin published the white paper on a new blockchain system he called ethereum he and several others developed it and the network went live 2 years later ethereum is a successful blockchain platform powered by its digital currency ether and has gained significant Global adoption while Regulators try to encourage blockchain technology they are hesitant about cryptocurrency due to its volatility and potential for misuse ethereum is an open Source Community run platform that powers thousands of decentralized applications its digital currency ether is the second largest in the world after Bitcoin Mr buim is now a director at the ethereum foundation this is a nonprofit body dedicated to supporting the technology I'm suikan executive editor of the Strait's [Music] time what do you think of like this the sing approach to crypto and and blockchain the Mas approach I definitely appreciate the amount of effort that they've been putting into it and just like their willingness to explore many different kinds of applications and be supportive interesting their willingness to uh trying to like make a distinction between blockchain usage and cryptocurrency is like one of those weird things right because it's like a it's like on the one hand it's sort of the mindset that every regulator has want to be supportive of technology and making things easier for people but like you know you find cryptocurrency weird and scary but on the other hand cryptocurrency do have this tight connection with each other you can't really have one without the other right like I think some of the Regulators in China definitely sort of tried to have one without the other and like the reality is I me know if you don't have cryptocurrency then like the blockchains that you're going to have are just fake and nobody's going to care about them but I guess the the line that they're trying to take is they're trying to like discourage cryptocurrency speculation but they're not actually Banning it and like you know people here who wants to like you know buy sell and have cryptocurrency still can if they want to there's even like banks that support cryptocurrency custodial Services possibly a good I think it could be a good balance Singapore's approach to crypto regulation is considered balanced aiming to prevent speculation while not outright Banning it however it faces the challenge of attracting both positive and negative elements of the crypto space check the price of ethereum like really really closely mhm sometimes but not always have you ever speculated at all in any crypto not really I just buy in whole things but some of the like smaller countries are into cryptocurrencies they are yes I mean some have gten like much further right like there's uh a couple of small ones that have like e- residencies that are on the blockchain definitely a lot of like small countries where the government is very involved what are your views on that is it like safe for them it depends on how they do it like I think there's a good ways to do it and there's bad ways to do it like I think the the biggest risk of being friendly is if you end up like attracting the terrible people right like the thing with the crypto space is that it's very high variant right the and the Mas are in there and it's like it's definitely true that like if a country is not smart about it then you know they can easily end up just like being stuck as being you know the base for all of the Duke one people and that's uh not necessarily something that a country would want but on the other hand like it is I think it's definitely possible to engage productively and get a lot of benefits do you see any danger of ethereum being used for not so good purposes what can you do about that yeah I think like um a couple of those things have happened right like there have been like defy hacks and those kinds of things the thing that we can do just as a community and that I think we've done fairly well at but we can do better is just like not have a community that's supportive of that kind of behavior High variance in the crypto space means attracting both genuine and dishonest individuals countries need to be careful to prevent the latter from dominating their crypto ecosystem while acknowledging past security breaches vitalic expresses confidence in ethereum's ability to improve its security through Community vigilance and proactive measures [Music] Singapore's approach to crypto regulation is considered balanced aiming to prevent speculation while not outright Banning it however it faces the challenge of attracting both positive and negative elements of the crypto space I see a description of myself and I just like totally can't relate to it like sometimes you know when people on Twitter make these memes of like myself with you know the really big muscles and like and like I don't know actually like I'm you know not that kind of person at all yeah I saw that one they had a like a funding right MH yeah did you laugh or were you angry I think I laugh if there's any city that you feel is home which city would that be huh I feel like maybe Singapore more than anywhere else now actually I feel like in The Last 5 Years it might be the place where the city I've spent the most time Som home okay thanks very much for having vitalic reflects on the media's portrayal of him emphasizing that he feels like others project their own expectations onto him he also acknowledges the growing significance of Singapore in his life considering it his current home here's an update to fear and greed index [Music] [Applause] thank you see you in the next update [Music]",

    "title": "Vitalik Buterin - What Excites Me About the Next Decade - TOKEN2049 Singapore 2024",
    "content": "a lot of the time when people talk about some of the challenges with crypto one of the answers that people tend to give is people tend to say you know this is still early days right we're still building we're still building out the basic infrastructure you know look how long something like the internet uh took to came into fruition right and this is something that I think people have been saying since uh like basically almost since Bitcoin itself launched and one of the challenges with saying this of course is that today you know we are not in early days anymore right Bitcoin has existed for 15 years ethereum as a project has existed for more than 10 years and uh you know we see things like Chad GPT rising up from not even existing as companies to suddenly completely changing everyone's understanding of what intelligence even is and so you have to ask the question of like well how do we actually even think about this right are we actually early and the way that I answer this question is I think we are not early to crypto but we are early to crypto actually being usable so let me explain what I mean with uh by going a little bit into history so who here remembers back in 2013 when we were all excited about Bitcoin and uh Bitcoin was the the next big thing Bitcoin was the next big revolution for payments and people were making these really amazing and really Earnest efforts to try to just get regular Merchants all around the world to start accepting Bitcoin who here remembers room 77 in Berlin anyone here eight there yeah so the one on the right this is Boston it's a restaurant called thonus monkfish that's actually the first Bitcoin restaurant that I want to so back in 2013 you could be a proud Bitcoin accepted here restaurant and also be a a proud LGBT Friendly restaurant at the same time and um you know crypto Twitter would not think that there is any contradiction uh so back at the time there was like real genuine excitement about this so what happened well one way to answer this is uh we can look a little bit further and uh the memory that comes to me is this to Argentina that I made in 2021 so this was my first time in Argentina and the first thing that I noticed was that there was this population Countrywide that was not just incredibly excited about crypto but that was actively using it on a massive scale like literally yeah I was walking around on Christmas Day and the first coffee shop that I noticed was open I walked in the owner knew who I was and the owner let me pay an e for the coffee and some dessert that I had with my friends now they were using crypto but they were not using decentralized technology what they what were they using it turns out the Argentinian locals were all using binance to binance transfers why binance to binance transfers are instant and binance to binance transfers are free and this is ultimately the same problem that I think ended up killing at least the original wave of exploration into getting everyone to adopt Bitcoin as a currency it was the fees if you remember the marketing at the very beginning why Bitcoin is great it talks a lot about how Western Union PayPal credit card companies they all just horribly gou you on fees they charge like incredibly High fees like they're awful right but then Bitcoin itself the fees went up to $50 um ethereum all the fees went up to the highest ever fee that I paid on uh ether was uh actually for a privacy preserving transaction so admittedly the gas went went up and uh you know basically like big parts of Twitter comment every time I do things so privacy protocols have a really good product Market fit and so the transaction feels about $800 so basically the reason why a lot of this stuff failed is fees what's new in 20124 well this is a chart of fees on ethereum lawyer 2s they have gone down from being somewhere between 10 and 50 cents to being under 1 cent basically zero at the same time optimism and arbitrum two major ethereum Lear ones have hit this important security Milestone that's called stage one and multiple ZK uh R evm rollups have also told me that they plan to head stage one very soon so rollups are rapidly becoming safer and rollups actually are finally affordable but this is not the only thing that's improved one of the other annoyances that I distinctly remember suffering on my trip to Argentina was uh I tried paying one of these people in eth on layer one the transaction fee was about $4 and the transaction took about 5 minutes to confirm now this was after EAP 1559 had come on chain but this particular wallet it had not actually upgraded to AP1 1559 yet so on bitcoin blocks come every 10 minutes and so you have to wait 10 minutes potentially an hour for transactions to confirm ethereum theoretically the block time is 13 seconds but because of the way that the gas market used to be really inefficient sometimes you'd have to wait a totally random amount if you get unlucky 5 minutes maybe even longer for a transaction to get included ep1 559 actually basically fixed this and if you add on the merge the one of the things that the merge did is it also cut in half the average waiting time until the next block and so with both of those those things actually these days I reliably have my own transactions confirmed in 5 to 15 seconds then if you use layer twos that have fast pre-confirmation often this gets down to 1 second and so basically the two big problems that are this the biggest things that made centralized ux much better than decentralized ux in 2021 today decentralized ux has them too but also we can look at the general us experience quality of applications so on the left here you have ether tweet from 2015 and you know it looked it clearly looks like a hackathon demo now on the right here you can look at Firefly which is a client for forecaster and Twitter and lens and if you look at the quality of the UI like this looks like a web 2 level of quality but it it's a decentralized application under the hood but also this year we saw progress in a account abstract we saw more and more people using safe we saw ZK email E 7702 we're starting to see mainstreaming in ZK sarks all kinds of different applications so we have new and better privacy protocols Railway Oxo uh zoo zoo pass which we'll talk about a bit later raro which can prove that in zero knowledge that you have a passport and then you could do voting on top of that also even existing ease of use improvements between ler 2s two years ago everyone was complaining about having to manually switch networks today I think like for a at least the last year I actually haven't yet manually had to switch networks so before the limitations of the technology were a stopping Factor like I even remember that moment where crypto kitties looked like it might become this really big breakout app but then what happened crypto Kitty own success pushed the ethereum gas price all the way up to 50 gay ethereum became basically unusable and that by itself put a ceiling on the grow this is noer true but this basically means that the reasons not to use crypto are noer here what about the reasons to come in the first place one of the uh mistakes that I think people sometimes make is uh talking about crypto as being an efficiency technology this is something that a lot of people talked about even back in 10 years ago so this is a a random page from 2013 that was just listing the benefits of accepting Bitcoin right so P Made Easy um security and control over your money zero or L Fe or low fees protect your identity right so two of the four are I think things are feat that are features that are very unique to crypto the other two well they were unique to crypto then but are they now right today we have venmo we have a much better sea payments there's WeChat pay the centralized systems keep getting better and better but yet in some places payments and access to finance remain durably difficult why do they remain difficult it's not because of access to technology it's uh basically because of limit limitations in global politics so I think it's important to remember right that the kinds of benefits that crypto brings to the world they don't have to do with technological improvements of the same type as switching from a regular jet to a supersonic jet is a techological Improvement it's a type of Technology what kind of typ so one way to look at this is uh this blog post that Josh Stark from the ethereum foundation wrote about two years ago and the title here is atoms institutions and blockchains and the thesis is that blockchains allow us to to create a kind of digital hardness any kind of social hardness basically that lets us create persistent digital structures that are hard that and that can resist being broken in the same way that you can make hard physical structur out of something like concrete and if you think about how how blockchains from some of the previous Cipher pug technologies that they came from things like mixnet things like tour things like bit torrent the thing that you realize is that blockchains are all about creating persistent structures that are extremely robust right so a file sharing Network well if a if your file share Network blows up that's fine you just switch to a different one and after a week everyone forgets if a blockchain blows up and you switch to a different one everyone loses all of their money this is a fundal difference between what technologies before blockchains did and what blockchains do and so blockchains because of this enable the internet to not just Route Around weaknesses in Old World structures but also do an actually better job of uh building better Alternatives that can solve similar kinds of problems so blockchains are digital concrete and digital concrete digital concrete for building digital Castles in the Sky so who here has uh seen this uh this movie a la Castle in the Sky raise your hand if you've seen it raise your hand if you know the opening theme song okay let's do a sing along [Music] [Music] so this is uh one of the actually so the reason why this movie is fun is I mean first of all I actually think it's like great and I think like studio gibl is absolutely top tier and you could probably tell I've seeing this like five times at least but um it turns out that it was like also somehow accidentally the inspiration for ethereum without us even me even realizing it basically what happened was in 2013 I was browsing a Wikipedia list of fictional elements right and I Came Upon ethereum in that list and in the list I saw okay this looks like a really nice name right and you know it reminds me of this 19th century scientific theory this idea that there's this medium that permeates everything and so okay fine I picked the name then two months later one of the ethereum foundation designers back before it was even called the ethereum foundation uh decided to use this diamond as the ethereum logo I thought okay this is a really cool diamond it's I like the logo it's beautiful years later I watched this movie for the first time and then I saw wait they have etherum cryst eum crysts look diamonds and so it turns that a of eum like art was uh inspired by this without even realizing it so and the other thing about that like that song right is that the song like it actually sounds nice right like I think in crypto you know we actually need better songs right it's like you know a lot of the time if you ask someone to like come up with an Anthem for a project like they come up with something that's totally cringe right it's like decentralized We Stand United a hash confirmed a new block invited like okay you know if you like rap then that's good right but uh do you really want that to be your Anthem forever right okay so I mean you know back in 2013 right there was this other song that I remember there there it was uh there was this artist named krya it's Q said and done all your Fe inflate be on the Sun but no more because now there's a better one and its properties perform better than all the rest of them it's mathematical no more double spend it's encrypt put your cash in your brain or it's wearable a new form of wealth begins wait who here actually remembers that one okay I do uh so see it like digital Castles in the Sky I think are the unifying theme that combines the serious and the fun aspects of crypto together this is what I want people to remember a castle is something that can protect you and keep your family and keep your tribe safe a castle can also be a castle in Disneyland that lets your community have fun a castle can also be a museum that preserves all of the entire thousand year history of your culture and a digital Castle similarly can be all of these things and dig and digital castles of all types are something that we can build on on top of ethereum so done with digital castles um what should our key goal be so this is I know my view that I've said the whole time right we need to satisfy the needs of mainstream adoption and we need to hold on to open source and decentralization values at the same time what does this mean so example one W it's right there's two to hold your m one of those you Bally you know you do like the crazy self- sovereignty maximalist thing you write down a seed phrase you do everything offline you take your seed phrase you engrave it on a piece of titanium you put your titanium inside of a lock box that's made out of even more titanium and then you like put that lock box 10 me undergound and then your coins are safe right so that's one approach the other approach is to say bro I'm like a normie I'm not going to do all that and so instead you basically go and you take your coins and you go off to give them to some trustworthy guy you know there's this nice guy his name is Sam he goes on panels with Bill Clinton he's got to be trustworthy and uh you know two years later it uh you know it turns out that your assessment of who's trustworthy and who's not was a little bit wrong so I think these are not the only two Alternatives right so basically if you want to be protected against centralized Bad actors then you do the traditional self- custody thing and if you really want you can put it in titanium and put it 10 met underground if you want to be protected from your own mistakes you do a centralized exchange what if you want both this is what smart wallets with multisig let you do multisig means you have multiple keys so you might have for example six keys out of which you need four to send a transaction and you could even have a rule that for small transactions you only need one and and those keys can be any combination of keys that you can contr um friends and family ZK rappers of existing services so you could even make a yaik rapper of an email you can literally today make an ethereum account which is a smart contract wallet from which you can only send transactions if you generate a proof that you canoll a particular email address right so you can basically take web 2 uh trust anchors and you can like pull them into the web 3 world and in the web 3 world you can even diversify your trust right so you can ZK w a Gmail account which is a US company then you could combine that to make another one of your Guardians be a ZK rapper of uh you know like an Indian government ID and then you make a third key be a hardware wall wallet that was made by a company in China right like you can maximally diversify everything and so even you you can actually get the benefits of institutional trust without a lot of the weaknesses so example 1.5 decentralized social media ux forecaster is a user experience wise warcast as a web2 quality app but you can set your recovery address the thing that has ultimate control over your account to be your multisig and I personally trust my multisig way more than any one of my centralized accounts example two payments so this is a doo it's a wallet that is meant to be entirely ethereum based but it has the same ux quality as venmo example three privacy pools privacy pools uses a mechanism where users can prove that their Depo their withdrawal came from some deposit without revealing which one but revealing that their deposit did not come from one of the bad guys and so this is a way that allows you to have a very high degree of privacy for regular users and meet a lot of uh important compliance needs but without actually having back doors example four ZK social media this is a zoo pole which uses zo pass and so can prove that you're a human prove that you're a member of a community solve proof of personhood problems solve reputation problems while still preserving your privacy it's not about either you're an Anon or no and nobody trusts you or you're KY didn't verify that you have no privacy it's like no you can have privacy and you can have trust at the same time example five ethereum layer one a lot of techological improvements that are happening that make the layer one both more performant in terms of red ring finality time increasing capacity and at the same time more decentralized and easy to verify and a lot of these things are already happening right so this like these are all directions that the ethereum ecosystem and I think crypto in general are going to be going over the next 10 years right we uh basically the two wrong paths are one is to sacrifice practicality for decentralization and forever being an ecosystem that's just appealing to itself and only has 691 users the other bad path is to sacrifice decentralization for practicality and to say okay well we're trying to get Mass adoption and so guess what the next great crypto application you have to log into it with a freaking Gmail account right what what do we do best well no you know we do not have to take either of these dark choices we have decentralization and we have practicality at the same time eat both pills be purple take both thank thank you",

    "title": "Vitalik: An Ethereum Story | Interviewing The Buterins",
    "content": "we're standing in front of imagined Cinemas in Toronto one of 30 theaters across the globe premiering the film vitalic an ethereum Story the film's production was funded through an nft crowdfund campaign called ethereum the infinite Garden purchasers of the bloom nft were granted access to the infinite token which gave them a film credit for the production we're here today to speak to to fans of ethereum and vitalic to understand their thoughts and feelings about the [Music] film so what brings you to the screening today I'm just a a big fan of ethereum and uh it's a lot about the merge I'm been following this movie for a while because it's been funded by a DA so they've been pretty open about it they're doing so and where they've been filming so yep so we've got uh vitalik's family here and we're really excited to celebrate the premiere of the film looking forward to what's to come um anything you all would like to say yeah sure I mean it's uh a theum started here in Toronto and actually as we were driving here my mom was remembering that vitalic high school was very close by you know on the other side of on College Street right so we're excited it's uh and uh this uh documentary has been I think three years in the making and I participated it for a bit and so I'm kind of looking forward to seeing all of that and it's also interesting that originally it was about ethereum but then they decided to make it more personal about vitalic right and that's cool and the end of the day ethereum is not about vitalic ethereum is so many people it's a huge community so many people working together but obviously it started because of vitalic right vitalic was a a very important aspect part of ethereum and you know it still is and uh I think that's a it's a big Testament also to his persistent right because I'm sure you've seen so many crypto projects you know boom and bust right and and theor has not been that way it's been uh many years in the making through so many dead ends and detours and problems and whatnot and it's going strong and I think that it's uh we're going to see in the next 10 years it will be so much more and you know uh the world might actually not even know about e theorum but it will be running in the background of so many aspects of our society so it's exciting for us to be here and I'm I'm really also happy that uh my parents got to see that because you know like uh we came from Soviet Union and I've been living here in Toronto for 25 years I've been living here for 14 13 years right and uh can has been a nice welcoming place for all of us and it became this foundation for the start eum so cool stuff yeah I'm Natalia amalin also known as vitalik's mother I'm here for the premiere of the movie uh very excited about it and uh looking forward to kind of relieve the moments uh of history of ethereum it's very exciting because it was uh you know one first movie that was crowded by the community I think it's amazing way to fundraise so I'm very excited that Community came together and um because of that people around the world have access to see the story of ethereum not just here but in a in other countries yeah there's 30 30 screenings tonight premiering around the world so very exciting for you and the family uh I like cryto space I work in it and you know some friends has some extra tickets so I thought I would come out do you have any expectations or knowledge but what the film's about anything you've uh I I watched the trailer it looked fine you know I've read and I've been around the space for a lot of time so totally fan um you know obviously read a lot of his works and you know used ethereum a lot so um yeah fan I think the initial reaction was I loved that I got to see very personal side of vitalic I think most of the time we see him giving lectures at conferences or giving interviews it's always about the tech which is awesome of course but just to see his journey from the start his family his dad where he was born and then where he grew up and where all these ideals came from I can see like with the history of Russia obviously that made him have certain ideals that drives him till this very day so I love that personal side of it and I think the film director and the producers did a great job my name is Malcolm and I love the film it was great getting to see vitalic behind the scenes um it's funny being in ethereum since 2020 he has actually taken a step back backwards and you get to see different parts of the ethereum community but it was nice actually getting the uh the full story from his point of view were there any particular favorite parts of the film or favorite themes that stood out for you the merge was my favorite part by far um the whole analogy with uh changing the engine of a car while it's driving that's going to stick with me uh for a while it was uh from a user perspective it uh it felt like no change at all but uh the amount of effort that went into it was uh looked amazing has the film changed your views about crypto and anyway and if so how so really hasn't I was bullish before going in and I'm staying bullish coming out what if anything will you be doing differently now that you've seen the film I think going in ethereum and building in the evm was uh was one pretty much my sole focus and uh and it'll stay that way yeah was there any particular favorite part of the film or theme that uh really spoke to you I think the theme of like looking through these different things happening globally plus like his own experiences playing into design decisions uh was something that I could relate to and was like uh really interesting part to see has the film changed your view about crypto in any way and if so how so I don't think so I always kind of thought of it as this like evolving machine um where you kind of have a free market and sometimes there's Bubbles and those bubbles pop but at the end of the day the things that are uh built to last and are worthwhile will continue to be e",
