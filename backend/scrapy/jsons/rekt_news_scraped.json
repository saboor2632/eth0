        "article": "\nPoly Network has been toppled from the top spot.\n~$624M stolen from Ronin Network.\nAnd nobody noticed for six days.\nWhen they did eventually realise, the Ronin team announced that:\n“We discovered the attack this morning after a report from a user being unable to withdraw 5k ETH from the bridge.”\nImagine how the Ronin team felt when they found out that the bridge had been drained nearly a week earlier.\nThe new biggest cryptocurrency hack ever.\nBut will the attacker be able to launder the loot?\n\nWith the rising popularity of Axie Infinity, Ronin was launched as an Ethereum side-chain in Feb 2021 to provide the fast, cheap transaction throughput necessary for a p2e game to function.\nIn order to maximise TPS, decentralisation and trustlessness were neglected in favour of a Proof of Authority model in which just nine validators put their reputation at stake, rather than processing any power or funds.\nOf these nine validators, a consensus of five is necessary to approve deposits and withdrawal transactions.\nFour of the validators are operated by Sky Mavis, meaning that in the event of a security breach, just one more signature was needed to control the network.\nAlthough the official Community Alert doesn't give details on how the Sky Mavis validators were compromised, it does point out the vulnerability that led to the attacker gaining control of the required fifth signature.\nThe attacker was able to gain access to the additional validator due to an arrangement made between Sky Mavis and the Axie DAO in November last year. A gas-free RPC node was established to ease costs for users during a period of heavy network traffic in which the AXS price peaked.\nThis required Axie DAO approving Sky Mavis validators to sign transactions on their behalf.\nDespite the arrangement only lasting until the following month, the whitelist access was never revoked, allowing the attacker who had compromised Sky Mavis validators to use the additional (Axie DAO) signature necessary to approve transactions.\nThe attacker then authorised two withdrawals, draining first 173,600 ETH and then 25.5M USDC from the Ronin Bridge contract. The 25.5M USDC were swapped for ETH via other addresses before being returned to the main wallet.\nPerhaps in an attempt to complicate the chase, 6250 ETH have been transferred from the wallet, some of which has since been transferred to FTX and Crypto.com. The address was also initially funded from Binance, but KYC’d accounts are easily acquired.\nThe rest of the funds remain in the attacker’s address:\n0x098b716b8aaf21512996dc57eb0615e2383e2f96\n\nThis theft will be remembered not just for its size, but for the surreal lack of awareness shown by the Ronin team.\nIt seems unthinkable that their key infrastructure was not monitored, with the only alert coming from a concerned user days later.\nIn their official statement, Sky Mavis has said that “Moving forward, the threshold will be eight out of nine” validators to approve transactions.\nHowever this was enacted almost 11 hours before the incident was officially announced.\nNo need to rush when it’s already been almost a week…\nAlthough most agree on its importance, decentralisation is sometimes seen as an academic, or moral distraction from the adrenaline of trading and the pursuit of profit.\nThis case shows the real importance of decentralisation.\nWhy hadn't the Ronin validator set been expanded further?\nAs we saw with the Wormhole case, when deep pockets stand to lose out, a bailout is no problem.\nAxie is considered the market leader in GameFi, does this incident present that same level of risk to an entire ecosystem?\nIf so, who’s bailing out $624M?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

More than the entire rekt.news leaderboard added together.\nThe biggest cryptocurrency hack... ever.\nPoly Network = rekt.\nBut how?\n\nCredit:breadcrumbs.app, slowmist, blocksec\nAttacker ETH: 0xc8a65fadf0e0ddaf421f28feab69bf6e2e589963\nAttacker BSC: 0x0D6e286A7cfD25E0c01fEe9756765D8033B32C71\nThis was not the usual smart contract flash loan / arbitrage affair.\nThe hacker exploited the Proxy Lock Contracts of Poly Network on three different chains.\nEthereum:0x250e76987d838a75310c34bf422ea9f1ac4cc906\nBSC:0x05f0fDD0E49A5225011fff92aD85cC68e1D1F08e\nPolygon:0x28FF66a1B95d7CAcf8eDED2e658f768F44841212\nCredit: @kelvinfichter\n\"Poly has a contract called the \"EthCrossChainManager\". It's a privileged contract that has the right to trigger messages from another chain. It's a standard thing for cross-chain projects.\nIt has a function named verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx that anyone can call to execute a cross-chain transaction.\nIt (1) verifies that the block header is correct by checking signatures (seems the other chain was a poa sidechain or) and then (2) checks that the transaction was included within that block with a Merkle proof. Here's the code.\nOne of the last things the function does is call executeCrossChainTx, which makes the call to the target contract. This is where the critical flaw sits. Poly checks that the target is a contract, but they forgot to prevent users from calling a very important target... the EthCrossChainData contract\nBy sending this cross-chain message, the user could trick the EthCrossChainManager into calling the EthCrossChainData contract, passing the onlyOwner check. Now the user just had to craft the right data to be able to trigger the function that changes the public keys…\nThe only remaining challenge was to figure out how to make the EthCrossChainManager call the right function. Now comes a little bit of complexity around how Solidity picks which function you're trying to call.\nThe first four bytes of transaction input data is called the \"signature hash\" or \"sighash\" for short. It's a short piece of information that tells a Solidity contract what you're trying to do.\nThe sighash of a function is calculated by taking the first four bytes of the hash of \"<function name>(<function input types>)\". For example, the sighash of the ERC20 transfer function is the first four bytes of the hash of \"transfer(address,uint256)\".\nPoly's contract was willing to call any contract. However, it would only call the contract function that corresponded to the following sighash:\n\nErrr but wait... \"_method\" here was user input. All the attacker had to do to call the right function was figure out some value for \"_method\" that, when combined with those other values and hashed, had the same leading four bytes as the sighash of our target function.\nWith just a little bit of grinding, you can easily find some input that produces the right sighash. You don't need to find a full hash collision, you're only checking the first four bytes. So is this theory correct?\nWell... here's the actual sighash of the target function:\nhttp://ethers.utils.id ('putCurEpochConPubKeyBytes(bytes)').slice(0, 10)\n'0x41973cd9'\nAnd the sighash that the attacker crafted...\nhttp://ethers.utils.id ('f1121318093(bytes,bytes,uint64)').slice(0, 10)\n'0x41973cd9'\nFantastic. No private key compromise required! Just craft the right data and boom... the contract will just hack itself!\nOne of the biggest design lessons that people need to take away from this is: if you have cross-chain relay contracts like this, MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN'T BE USED TO CALL SPECIAL CONTRACTS. The EthCrossDomainManager shouldn't have owned the EthCrossDomainData contract.\nSeparate concerns. If your contract absolutely needs to have special privileges like this, make sure that users can't use cross-chain messages to call those special contracts.\"\n\nOn the Ethereum blockchain, the hacker stole\nUSDC - 96,389,444\nWBTC - 1,032\nDAI - 673,227\nUNI - 43,023\nSHIBA - 259,737,345,149\nrenBTC- 14.47\nUSDT - 33,431,197\nwETH - 26,109\nFEI USD - 616,082\nOn BSC, the hacker stole:\nBNB - 6,613.44\nUSDC - 87,603,373\nETH - 299\nBTCB - 26,629\nBUSD - 1,023\nOn the Polygon blockchain, the hacker stole:\nUSDC - 85,089,610\nTOTAL VALUE LOST - ~$611,000,000\nAt the time of writing, the stolen funds are located in the following wallets:\nETH: 0xC8a65Fadf0e0dDAf421F28FEAb69Bf6E2E589963\nBSC: 0x0D6e286A7cfD25E0c01fEe9756765D8033B32C71\nPolygon: 0x5dc3603C9D42Ff184153a8a9094a73d461663214\n\nDeFi storylines are rarely straightforward, and this one is no exception.\nEven anonymous actors adore attention.\nShortly after the exploit, an unexpected protagonist appeared, going by the name of hanashiro.eth.\nhanashiro.eth first gained attention when they sent the hacker a tip about how to handle USDT, for which they received 13.37 Ether from the hacker as a reward.\nMany others sent messages to the hacker afterwards, but none were quite as successful as hanashiro.eth.\nWith a truly crypto native level of philanthropic showmanship, hanashiro.eth went on to donate their stolen money to a few of the foundational organisations which support our industry, such as Infura, Etherscan, and rekt.news.\nBut not all of the funds were so freely accessible.\nTether froze all of the 33M USDT that were stolen on the Ethereum chain.\nTheir coin - their choice… A fact worth remembering if you use USDT.\nBy this point the shit had really hit the fan; and all eyes were on Poly Network, who resorted to posting an open letter to the attacker begging them to return the funds.\nA single tweet asking a criminal to return six hundred million dollars... Maybe Gensler was right when he said we are in the “Wild West” phase of cryptocurrency.\nConsider the mindset of the attacker at this point in the story. Which do you think they felt more; euphoria, or terror?\nStealing 600 million dollars whilst sat at your computer must be a surreal experience.\nThe experience of then trying to launder that money must be equally intense.\nAside from JPEGS, tornado.cash would be the obvious starting point, and that’s exactly where our hacker went.\nThey sent themself a transaction containing the message;\nWonder why Tornado? Will miners stop me? Teach me please\nWas that psyops or stupidity? In crypto it’s never quite clear...\nOn the run with 600 million, and broadcasting messages to an audience of thousands.\nThe hacker was growing too confident.\n\nWhen @WardBradt tweeted the following;\nDid the PolyNetwork Exploiter accidentally use the wrong sender address for this tx 0xb12681d9e? The sender address is tied to FTX, Binance, Okex accounts.\nSuddenly the attacker's attitude changed.\nSurely a hacker who feels confident enough to attempt an attack of this scale wouldn’t make such a basic OPSEC error? Or maybe they used fake KYC documents…\nEither way, we began to see signs of fear from the attacker.\nThe hacker began to suggest that they might return \"some tokens\" or even abandon them, saying that they were \"not so interested in the money\".\nThen the hacker considered the idea of creating a DAO to distribute the stolen funds.\nFinally, the pressure became too much, and the hacker announced that they were “READY TO SURRENDER”\nIn an unexpected and unprecedented move, the attacker is now returning the funds to Poly Network.\nThey announced that they were \"READY TO RETURN THE FUNDS!\" in an Ethereum transaction that was sent from the same wallet used for the attack.\nBefore sending the first return transaction, the hacker created a token called \"The hacker is ready to surrender\" and sent this token to Poly Network who announced that they had set up a multisig controlled by ‘’known Poly addresses’’.\nA summary of the hackers' communication with Poly Network can be found here.\nAt the time of writing, the hacker has returned the following:\nOn the Ethereum blockchain: $2.6M\nOn the BSC: $1.1M\nOn the Polygon blockchain: $1M\nWill the hacker continue to return the funds, or is this just another stunt?\nCan they really just return the money and be forgiven?\n\nPoly Network. 611 million.\nAnd you thought you knew all the big protocols in DeFi.\nThis industry has grown bigger than our echo chamber can handle.\nThis may be the first, but it won’t be the last hack of this size that we will see over the coming years. Yet the market seems unfazed, and rightly so.\nFor better or for worse, crypto will make the news, and the world will have to take notice as our industry becomes the norm.\nThis is just another inevitable part of the progress.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The transactions occurred at 18:26 UTC and 20:43 UTC.\nThe bridge uses vulnerable IAVL verification which the attacker was able to forge, specifically for block 110217401, from August 2020.\nExploiter’s address: 0x489a8756c18c0b8b24ec2a2b9ff3d4d447f79bec\nAs samczsun put it:\nIn summary, there was a bug in the way that the Binance Bridge verified proofs which could have allowed attackers to forge arbitrary messages. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, but the damage could have been far worse\nFor a detailed explanation, see the full thread.\nRather than dumping the BNB directly and drawing attention to the price action, funds were deposited as collateral on BSC lending platform Venus Protocol. Amidst the confusion, the Venus team were keen to point out that their protocol hadn’t suffered an exploit, although their users faced a spike in rates as borrow liquidity was withdrawn.\nThe tactic of borrowing rather than dumping initially led some to believe that this may just be a gigawhale moving funds around. However, as users began to notice high-slippage swaps and Tether blacklisting funds, it became clear that this was something more sinister.\nLikely anticipating that Binance would halt the chain, the exploiter raced to find liquidity to bridge and move as much of the loot as possible to other chains.\nSlowMist traced the movement of funds. First, the attacker supplied 900k BNB to Venus, borrowing a total of $147M in stablecoins, before bridging to Ethereum and L2s, Fantom (now making up over 10% of TVL), Avalanche and Polygon networks.\nSee SlowMist’s table below for a breakdown of the exploiter’s positions, including frozen USDT (totalling ~$6.5M).\n\nWhen the BNB team halted the chain, approximately 90 mins after the second transaction, the hacker lost access to the ~$430M still on their BSC address. The hacker’s addresses were initially funded from ChangeNOW exchange.\n\nSince the incident, Binance comms have gone into damage limitation mode.\nAn official update states that “decentralised chains are not designed to be stopped”. But with just “26 active validators”, does BNB chain qualify as decentralised in the first place?\nAnd was it ever, really, credibly decentralised?\nThe update also sets out some next steps, including governance votes to decide on whether to freeze or burn the stolen funds, and establishing Bug Bounty and whitehat bounty programmes.\nThe number of “community validators” will also be increased in a “move toward further decentralisation” (or reduced responsibility).\nCovering the funds that found their way off-chain is a drop in the ocean for Binance.\nAnd as CZ makes clear, his size is size: “The current impact estimate is around $100m USD equvilent, about a quarter of the last BNB burn.”\nHowever, the Binance CEO has also distanced himself from the incident, tweeting that he is “not that involved in the technical side of BNB Chain. Far less than Vitalik with ETH.” possibly attempting to convince any regulators looking for a DeFi scapegoat that their attentions should be directed elsewhere…\nIf the chain could have been paused this time, why not for all the other BSC hacks we’ve covered? And how will this look in the eyes of regulators, now that it’s clear they’ve been in control the entire time…\nMore importantly, though, a dangerous precedent has been set by pressing pause on such a heavily-used network. If we ever reach mass-adoption of crypto for day-to-day transactions, how could these acts be justified when chain halts could, ultimately, mean the difference between life and death?\nBut, as this video from 2019 shows, CZ doesn’t regard the immutability of blockchains as sacrosanct. Although the plan never went ahead, he contemplates the rolling back of the Bitcoin network despite the “far reaching consequences” and risk of “destroying credibility”.\nWill BNB’s involvement in “DeFi” retain any credibility after today?\nFor now, though, it’s just another bridge exploit, and one more entry on the leaderboard.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Ray III had some strong words about SBF’s management abilities:\nNever in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.\n…and coming from the man who oversaw the aftermath of Enron, that’s saying a lot.\nThe documents also provide a look into the dire state of SBF’s empire with highlights including:\nThe value of “Crypto Assets Held at Fair Value” by FTX.com is estimated at just $659k, rather than SBF’s previous claim of ~$5B (of “semi-liquid” shitcoins).\nLoans totalling $3.3B from Alameda to SBF and his Paper Bird Inc.\nThe statement that “corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees”.\nFTX and Alameda “do not have an accounting department”\nPlus the following description of their operational practices:\nUnacceptable management practices included the use of an unsecured group email account as the root user to access confidential private keys and critically sensitive data for the FTX Group companies around the world, the absence of daily reconciliation of positions on the blockchain, the use of software to conceal the misuse of customer funds, the secret exemption of Alameda from certain aspects of FTX.com’s auto-liquidation protocol, and the absence of independent governance as between Alameda [and FTX.com].\n\nDespite SBFs interviews, “leaked” DMs,, and his continued presence on Twitter, many questions remain unanswered.\nThe reason behind the removal of $633M from FTX on the 12th of November is perhaps the most pressing.\n$477M of this amount was apparently due to “unauthorized access”, with FTX staff sending the remainder to a secure multisig pending bankruptcy proceedings.\nWhile SBF’s leaked DMs chalk it up to a hack by an “ex-employee, or malware on an ex-employee’s computer”, Bahamian authorities claim to have instructed the draining of FTX wallets. It’s unclear whether this refers to the $477M figure or the “rescued” funds.\n1) What?!\nThe FTX Accounts Drainer address has since swapped assets to ETH making it the 30th largest ETH holder. Much of the swaps incurred significant slippage and appeared to be a scramble towards uncensorable assets (though $100M were frozen), behaviour which is far from expected by government agency.\nWe’ll put the $477M on the leaderboard, although no detailed official explanation or post mortem has yet been released.\nThis article will be updated as the situation becomes clearer.\n\nThe true damage from the collapse of FTX and Alameda is an order of magnitude greater than the funds lost in the hack, and the wider fallout will be far greater still.\nDespite his U-turn on the effectiveness of regulators, SBF’s actions and the fallout they continue to create will pave the way for a harsh crackdown which will affect all corners of the industry.\nBut the crypto movement is bigger than the failures of the past week.\nOr at least, it will be...\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Due to a discrepancy between ‘solana_program::sysvar::instructions’ (a precompile of sorts) and the ‘solana_program’ Wormhole was using, the contract didn’t correctly verify the address being provided, and the attacker was able to provide an address containing just 0.1 Eth.\n3: Using an account created hours earlier with a single serialised instruction corresponding to the Sep256k1 contract, the attacker was able to fake the ‘SignatureSet’, call ‘complete_wrapped’ and fraudulently mint 120k whETH on Solana using VAA verification that had been created in a previous transaction.\n4: 93,750 ETH was bridged back to Ethereum over the course of 3 transactions, (one, two, three) where it still remains in the hacker’s wallet. The remaining ~36k whETH were liquidated on Solana into USDC and SOL.\nAn on-chain message was sent to the hacker from Certus One, the team behind the Wormhole bridge:\nThis is the Wormhole Deployer:\nWe noticed you were able to exploit the Solana VAA verification and mint tokens. We’d like to offer you a whitehat agreement, and present you a bug bounty of $10 million for exploit details, and returning the wETH you’ve minted. You can reach out to us at contact@certus.one.\nA $10M bug bounty is the biggest we’ve seen.\nKeep your innocence, plus $10M, or go on the run with $326M.\nWhich would you choose?\nAs Wormhole have yet to receive any response to their offer, it seems the attacker has chosen the criminal route…\n\nWe spoke to the founders of Wormhole, and asked how they managed to replace so much ETH so quickly.\nAfter waiting for some time, they would only tell us that they are currently writing a more detailed incident report.\nIt’s not been a good start to the year for Solana.\nThe last few months has seen the network experience a number of outages and disruptions. However, in the recent January crash, users were unable to top up their collateral and avoid liquidation, with oracle issues leading to further erroneous liquidations.\nThat being said, Solana is not yet the battle-hardened network that Ethereum has grown to be. Every exploit, for all the damage it does, offers a lesson for how to secure an evolving ecosystem. Newer L1s are thrown into the deep end, into a world of veteran exploiters where they will either sink or learn to swim.\nGiven the seriousness of this incident, along with the Qubit exploit last week and last summer’s mammoth attack on Poly Network, Vitalik Buterin seems to have been proven right about his recent security concerns around cross-chain protocols.\nIn the race across the cryptoverse to reach experimental and more lucrative opportunities, many are willing to trust in newer tech. But when one of these gateways fails, the damage done can be immense.\nIt remains to be seen whether the future of DeFi will be cross-chain or ‘multi-chain’, but either way, the journey there will be long and dangerous.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The signature service of DMM Bitcoin is attacked or the multi-sig private key is compromised. Then the attacker used a similar historical transfer address to receive funds to avoid detection and alert.\nThe exchange wallet controller suffered from an address spoofing scam, that is, only the first 5 digits and the last 2 digits of the receiving address were checked during the transfer, resulting in the transfer to the hacker address.\nAttack Transaction:\n975ec405ac9dc9fa5ab8009d94d6a1fe31dff8a8127ea90d023104e52754e4d7\nExploiter Address:\n1B6rJRfjTXwEy36SCs5zofGMmdv2kdZw7P\nThe exploiter sent the bitcoin to the addresses below:\nbc1qegcazuxnp5wxxxamdqvjv345fpve6656vpjln4\nbc1qgcv2j80009apvjekph40wagwutfu6l3gcm2fw0\nbc1q2u9m2eqy8glvrjeqr5sceqngpad6dnxrtyxlf3\nbc1q2tu4dxyvnaquar96mj99yqjanfzgg3fv4gzytd\nbc1q7p3atj3v95k4pd7qxnnqlhjwu843ty2hqn9gy0\nbc1qr4vnu4f4tl3gwfxt6a5hgt6vuusgsd0j2cnz74\nbc1q3ur23g02rq5w0x6y8vek3xradjgs080nzksfje\nbc1qrtltlc7zjzj3knde2tqjt7tl2p5l2keh4l2uka\nbc1qx6jpnnfjrfcx9ehhdmj7qqyzpyd8pek00trrq7\nbc1q7pdecv2raf3x84unxlv9ghtpjfpwlam6dx27xd\nArkham Intel is offering a bounty to help identify the perpetrator(s).\nThe bounty guidelines are identifying a KYC centralized exchange deposit, revealing the identity of the exploiter and successful effort to return funds.\nWith the hacker's transactions being closely tracked, will blockchain forensics and the bounty program lead to their unmasking and recovery of the $304 million?\n\nWhat could go down as one of the biggest heists in our industry, became another prime example of not your keys, not your crypto.\nDMM has vowed to make customers whole, but restocking that mountain of bitcoin won't be easy or cheap.\nThe creation of the bounty program on Arkham Intel could potentially aid in recovering the stolen funds or identifying the perpetrators.\nWhile on-chain sleuths have cracked some historic hacks, this trail of tainted coins spread across multiple addresses could prove a byzantine blockchain maze.\nAll eyes are glued to see if the bounty hunters can work their magic and resolve this rektoning before it solidifies DMM's legacy as crypto's biggest Rekt of 2024.\nThe root cause of the attack has yet to be revealed, whether it is an address spoofing incident, private key compromise or even an inside job, remains to be seen.\nKeeping that large amount of funds in a hot wallet as opposed to a cold wallet is just reckless.\nWill the hackers drift off into crypto infamy, their $304 million score burning a hole in the industry's reputation?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nWazirX, India's leading crypto exchange, took a massive $235 million hit when it's Safe multisig wallet crumbled under a devastating breach.\nCyvers sounded the alarm shortly after the attack, detecting multiple suspicious transactions being funded by Tornado Cash making moves on the platform.\nThey attempted to contact WazirX during the explicit, but it was too late, as the attacker was already swapping the stolen tokens to ETH and making their exit.\nRoughly half an hour later, WazirX confirmed the security breach and that they were pausing withdrawals.\nWazirX is sliding into number 7 on the infamous Rekt Leaderboard, right behind this year’s biggest hack, so far, DMM Bitcoin, which lost $304 million at the end of May.\nDMM Bitcoin was another centralized exchange that fell victim to a multisig compromise.\nHow many times do we need to be reminded of not your keys, not your crypto?\n\nCredit: Cyvers, WazirX, Mudit Gupta, ZachXBT, Arkham Intel\nThe WazirX hack was a masterclass in patience and deception.\nAccording to a technical breakdown provided by Mudit Gupta, the attackers began laying the groundwork at least 8 days before the main event, conducting small test transactions to set the stage.\nTheir target? WazirX's multisig wallet, which had six signatories, five from WazirX and one from Liminal, their custody provider. This was confirmed by WazirX in their preliminary report of the exploit.\nInstead of a straightforward drain, the hackers opted for a more insidious approach. They set out to upgrade the multisig wallet to a malicious version under their control.\nTo achieve this, they needed to overcome WazirX's security measures, which included Ledger Hardware Wallets for signatories and a whitelist policy for destination addresses.\nThe attackers likely compromised two of the four required private keys directly. For the remaining two, they employed signature phishing, tricking signers into approving what appeared to be a normal USDT transfer.\nThis deception extended to Liminal's interface, where WazirX suspects a discrepancy between the displayed data and the actual transaction contents allowed the payload to be replaced.\nMinutes before the hack, a legitimate USDT transfer failed, a red flag that went unnoticed.\nTwo of the four signatures were actually for upgrading the safe to the malicious contract, not for the USDT transfer.\nWith all pieces in place, the hackers executed their exploit.\nUsing the two compromised keys and the two phished signatures, they successfully upgraded the multisig to their malicious contract.\nCritically, one of the phished signatures came from Liminal Custody, the co-signer responsible for final checks.\nThis suggests a significant failure in Liminal's verification process, a vulnerability the attackers exploited to devastating effect.\nWith the upgrade complete, the attackers gained full control of the wallet, allowing them to drain funds at will.\nZachXBT's investigation revealed a complex trail of transactions, broken down into a timeline as follows...\nJuly 8th:\nA ChangeNOW hot wallet sent two transactions to this address:\n0xC891b507A7c109179d38E2Cb4DE6CD8Dc70D2ad4\n2 Transactions:\n0.36 ETH:

WazirX hacker.\nThis intricate web of transactions reveals the meticulous planning and execution behind the WazirX hack.\nThe attackers' use of privacy tools, test transactions, and multiple addresses demonstrates a level of sophistication not seen in most crypto heists.\nMudit Gupta made a good point in his analysis, “It's a very methodical and organized attack, pointing towards DPRK as the hacker.”\nThis has yet to be confirmed, but you never know…\nCould this be another case of state-sponsored crypto theft?\n\nThis $235 million heist not only shakes user confidence but also raises questions about the efficacy of current custody solutions and multisig implementations.\nIn a world where even the most robust security measures can be bypassed, is entrusting large sums to any single entity, no matter how reputable, a risk worth taking?\nThe rise of sophisticated, possibly state-sponsored attacks adds a chilling new dimension to an already treacherous landscape.\nWith data breaches becoming the norm, the rise of phishing attacks and compromised private keys and multisig a rising concern lately.\nWe have to ask, where is it safe to store our funds?\nThe short answer is obviously not centralized exchanges.\nIs the only path forward a world where every user becomes their own bank, guardian and last line of defense?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public

Just before the incident, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eirc Balchunas raised his odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission greenlighting the products to 75% from 25% and the market went on a moon mission.\nBucking the uptrend seen in other tokens following news of a possible Ethereum ETF approval, GALA's initial plunge of around 20% stood in stark contrast to the broader market rally.\nAs investors grappled with the implications of the exploit, fears surrounding the security breach led to a sell-off that saw GALA's price fall\nAlthough the token managed to recover some ground in the ensuing hours, the damage had already been done, with GALA ultimately failing to capitalize on the positive momentum sweeping the rest of the crypto market.\nThe day after the exploit, the funds were sent back by the exploiter.\nYet the multi-million dollar question remained, who was behind this brazen attack on Gala?\n\nCredit: The Vulture Trade, Gala Games, Hacken, Benefactor, The Block, Crypto Times, Tay\nAt the core of what could have been a $216 million crypto heist was a critical access control failure.\nThe hacker's path to pillaging Gala Games was paved by allegedly obtaining unauthorized access to an all-powerful admin account on the GALA token contract.\nAccording to the attack breakdown by Hacken, the exploit involved an “Access Control” attack vector, where a malicious actor gained control over a dormant MINTER account on the GALA token contract that had not been used for 180 days.\n\nThe attacker minted 5 billion $GALA tokens to a new address dubbed “Gala Game Exploiter”\nAttack transaction:\n0xa6d90abe17d17743a9cecab84bcefb0fd0bbfa0c61bba60fd2f680b0a2f077fe\nFollowed by the minting, the compromised account sent 2 ETH to Gala Exploiter to possibly cover gas fees for further transactions.\nThe exploiter started exchanging the freshly minted GALA for ETH, executing transactions up to 100 ETH.\nGALA for ETH swaps:0xe2ca471124b124831e231fb835778840ad100f97\n2 hours and 16 minutes later, Gala admins intervened by blocking the exploiter’s account, halting further transactions.\nBlocked Account:\n0x15129c219a94e24d40541e622757973c0664338f117ff6c4b68d845854b167b9\nThe exploiter transferred all the stolen ETH back to the Minter account.\nMinter Account:\n0x273c6b54fea8b0d616fb3270698dd4387ec3fefc7b0e290330b4019c35a984b1\nAfter that, all the ETH was transferred from the MINTER account to a new externally owned account, possibly by the Gala team to secure the funds.\nExternally Controlled Account:0x16a96053f8e6382a32caa1a4461bf8c500d788019685b803ad3a3194fa5dd290\n3 days before the exploit, Jason Brink aka Bitbender, announced he was shifting his role at Gala from being President of Blockchain to being an unpaid advisor.\nHe also mentioned that a number of people will also be resigning from their positions at Gala to form an external organization, LFG (Let’s Fight Giants).\nThe timing is suspicious, especially given some of the shady past of Gala Games.\nIn early 2021, Gala Games lost $130 million after around 8.65 billion GALA tokens were stolen. Eric Schiermeyer, one of the firm's co-founders, sued Wright Thurston, the other co-founder, for allegedly participating in the hack.\nThurston then issued his own lawsuit against Schiermeyer claiming that he used company funds for personal use, The Block previously reported.\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission also sued Thurston and another of these companies in March 2023 for allegedly selling $18 million worth of unregistered securities in the form of GREEN, a cryptocurrency related to a public global decentralized power grid.\nIn November of 2022 Gala Games urged its community for calm after misplaced fears of a multibillion-dollar rug pull or hack caused the GALA token to temporarily crash 25.6%.\nThe initial panic, which Gala Games tried to debunk hacking rumors, after a single wallet address appeared to mint over $2 billion in GALA tokens out of thin air.\nSomething sounds oddly familiar with the previous minting incident.\nWith a track record of unexplained billion-dollar mints and $130 million insider heists, this latest $216 million incident reeks of potential internal sabotage.\nIs Gala the one playing games here?\n\nThe shadow cast by the previous incidents at Gala Games, including insider heists and legal troubles, contributes to the aura of suspicion that now surrounds the company.\nThe departure of key figures just days before the latest exploit and the history of unexplained token mints do little to allay fears.\nIn a space where trust is paramount, Gala Games finds itself at a critical juncture, where the next steps it takes could either restore confidence or further erode its standing within the community.\nDWF Labs announced the day after the incident, that they have purchased 28 million $GALA tokens ($1.2M) to stabilize the token's value and express support for Gala.\nSo maybe business will carry on as usual and any suspicions just may get swept under the rug, again.\nTime in the crypto space feels as if it moves faster than the speed of light at times, attention spans are short and memories even shorter.\nThe market's resilience, often bouncing back from scandals and breaches, is a testament to the robust enthusiasm for the blockchain space.\nWill Gala emerge stronger and more secure, or will it become a cautionary tale?\nOnly time will tell if these red flags are truly just coincidences or harbingers of deeper issues within.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

An english summary of the livestream (promised in the initial announcement) is yet to be published.\nNews of a relatively unheard-of platform losing nine figures brings back memories of Poly Network’s leaderboard-topping incident in August 2021. And just goes to demonstrate the vast disconnect between crypto communities across the globe.\nMixin Network claims to be “decentralised”, but has blamed the losses on a hacked third-party database.\nSomething doesn’t add up...\n\nThe details of precisely how funds were drained have not yet been disclosed.\nBut Mixin wasted no time in shifting the blame:\nthe database of Mixin Network's cloud service provider was attacked by hackers, resulting in the loss of some assets on the mainnet\nThe transactions appear to be simple transfers, which would suggest a leak of Mixin users’ private keys held on the cloud service.\nBlockSec also believe that some of the addresses drained may have been Mixin’s hot wallets.\nThe stolen funds accounted for so far are comprised of ETH, USDT (swapped to unfreeable DAI) and BTC, with not an illiquid shitcoin in sight.\nThe announcement states that Mixin is in contact with Google (presumably the ‘service provider’ in question) and SlowMist to aid in the investigation.\nAttacker addresses (identified so far, with approx $50M still to be accounted for):\n0x52E86988bd07447C596e9B0C7765F8500113104c - Received 60k ETH ($94M)\n0x3B5fb9d9da3546e9CE6E5AA3CCEca14C8D20041e - Received USDT, swapped to DAI ($23.5M)\n0xB5d631A74AD9c9efcF96d6e9e2fAbcB75C67Eafa - Used to disperse ETH to victim addresses for gas to transfer USDT\nbc1qq7uefmz6nng5c4dzs9mwrxxyh9sxg5cjg85hes - Received 891 BTC ($23M)\nIf the $200M figure stated by Mixin is accurate, it would make this incident the biggest hack of 2023 so far, knocking March’s $197M exploit of Euler Finance (funds later returned) off the top spot.\nAs assets currently remain in the drainer wallets, there may be some hope for Mixin’s request for funds to be returned (with a $20M bounty), though the swapping of UDST to DAI is not a good sign.\nThis case has many of the hallmarks of a Lazarus heist, who have been plenty busy lately.\nIf it does turn out to be Lazarus, the funds will soon be getting a good Mixin’…\n\nBy blaming a third-party, as Nansen also did on Friday, Mixin is attempting to hide from one of crypto’s most important tenets: accountability.\nUsing a web2 service provider for sensitive on-chain data goes against everything about the origins of this industry.\nAnd given LayerZero’s latest partnership, they may have some reassuring to do…\nWith a constant stream of hacks, leaks and scams, flooding the timeline, it begins to feel like working in an online minefield.\nBut that's the point.\nThis was a hack, not an exploit.\nYet another case of legacy infrastructure failing, yet another reason to be working towards a more secure future…\nAs the darkest days of bear market apathy grind on, it becomes ever-harder to stay motivated.\nBut for those building genuine, robust protocols for a future true to crypto’s original ideals, remember:\ndecentralization doesnt matter\nuntil it really really does\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Euler’s TVL dropped from $264M to just $10M.\nAny hopes of a whitehat were quickly put to bed; an associated address had previously been used to exploit BSC-based EPMAX before depositing the proceeds to Tornado Cash.\nHow did it go so wrong?\n\nCredit: _FrankResearcher, Omniscia,\nLending on Euler is managed via eTokens (collateral) and dTokens (debt), with liquidations triggered when a user has more dTokens than eTokens.\nThe exploited vulnerability involved the little-used donateToReserves function which was incorporated into Euler via EIP14 last year. donateToReserves allows users to send eTokens to directly to Euler reserves, however does not contain a check on the health of the user’s position.\nThe hacker took advantage of this by using two contracts, one of which would incur bad debt via donateToReserves, and the other would act as liquidator.\nUsing flash-loaned funds and Euler’s leverage system to create a large, underwater position on one contract, the liquidator contract could obtain the inflated eToken collateral at a discount, and withdraw into the underlying assets.\nOmniscia, one of Euler’s six auditors, published a detailed post-mortem, summing up the issue as follows:\nThe attack ultimately arose from an incorrect donation mechanism and did not account for the donator’s debt health, permitting them to create an unbacked DToken debt that will never be liquidated.\nAttacker’s address (where funds remain): 0xb66cd966670d962c227b3eaba30a872dbfb995db\nExample tx (DAI): 0xc310a0af…\nSlowMist provided a summary of the addresses and transactions involved: total losses comprised 86k in ETH derivatives ($134.6M), 849 WBTC ($18.6M), 34M USDC, 8.9M DAI.\nAuditors and smart contract insurance protocol Sherlock has taken responsibility for missing the vulnerability in their review of EIP-14 last year, and will pay a claim of $4.5M to Euler.\nEuler reached out to the attacker’s address via tx input data:\nWe understand that you are responsible for this morning's attack on the Euler platform. We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps.\nBut with some funds having been sent to Tornado via a pass-through address in what seems like a test, the prospects of returned funds aren’t looking good…\n\nGiven Euler’s high-profile and stable reputation, many other DeFi organisations had funds tied up in the protocol.\nThe fact that so many other projects chose to integrate with Euler is a testament to just how shocking this exploit has been for the community. And many have reached out in support of the Euler team.\nIn addition to Euler itself (whose token, EUL, fell over 50%), the fallout affected the following projects:\nAngle Protocol (over $17M of agEUR collateral, ANGLE down over 50%)\nBalancer ($11.9M of bbeUSD)\nTemple DAO ($5M, TEMPLE down 30%)\nIdle DAO (~$5M)\nSwissborg ($2.6M in ETH and $1.7M of USDT)\nYield Protocol ($1.5M)\nYearn ($1.38M of indirect exposure, losses to be covered by Treasury)\nInverse Finance ($800k)\nAnd others\nDeFi’s composability allows us to build interesting, automated and lucrative money legos in a way that traditional finance could never pull off.\nWhen things go wrong, however, there’s no stopping the on-chain reaction.\nThe last few days have shown the necessity of a resilient alternative in an increasingly delicate global economy.\nSpurred on by disasters such as this, we continue to build out robust architecture, laying ever-stronger foundations for DeFi's future.\nBut in the meantime… is anywhere truly safe?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The only substantial remaining asset balance is ~$40M of BitMart’s own token, presumably because of the difficulty unloading it outside of the exchange.\nThe affected wallet on BSC: 0x8c128dba2cb66399341aa877315be1054be75da8\nBreakdown of losses by token on Ethereum (~$100M).\nBreakdown of losses by token on BSC (~$96M).\nThe hacker transferred BitMart user funds from the hot wallets to the following addresses:\nEthereum 1: 0x39fb0dcd13945b835d47410ae0de7181d3edf270\nEthereum 2: 0x4bb7d80282f5e0616705d7f832acfc59f89f7091\nBSC: 0x25fb126b6c6b5c8ef732b86822fa0f0024e16c61\nFrom there, the various memecoins were swapped via 1inch to ETH and BNB before being washed via TornadoCash.\nBitMart is still investigating what caused the security breach, and has yet to comment on any reimbursement for affected users.\nThe Security section of their website states that <0.5% of their assets are kept in hot wallets.\nThis puts BitMart’s total assets at over $39 billion…\nIf that figure is really true, then a full refund for affected users should be no problem.\n\nCentralised platforms exist as a trusted go-between for those who may have reservations about interacting directly with crypto.\nUsers give up custody of their assets with the expectation that the people managing them are experts in security and best practise.\nIt remains to be seen how the attacker managed to gain access to the wallets in question.\nHopefully it wasn’t another basic OPSEC error such as granting unlimited approvals to an EOA, as in Celsius’ case.\nThese are understandable mistakes when it comes to individuals and smaller balances. But at this level it’s hard to forgive, especially when CeFi represents the corrupt legacy financial system cashing in on the innovation of DeFi.\nA Cayman-registered corporation has lost close to $200M. Their communications team first denied and then downplayed the losses. All this while freezing withdrawals until out of the news cycle, when the fear of a “bank run” has subsided.\nDo these middlemen deserve to take a profit?\nAnd if they insist on doing so, will BitMart at least commit to refunding their users?\n\nIf you enjoy our work, please consider donating to our Gitcoin Grant\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

And when they go, it's often a total collapse.\n\n$190M... devoured.\nThe collateral damage from the unbacked assets is also severely affecting the chains that depended on Nomad. Moonbeam, EVMOS and Milkomeda have all taken a significant hit to their TVLs.\nThis incident is distinct in its every-man-for-himself nature, but many who exploited the bug have declared themselves whitehats… Rekt is looking forward to seeing how much is eventually returned…\nEven so, with four of our leaderboard’s top 5 entries being cross-chain attacks, it gets ever more difficult to agree with Nomad’s slogan “The future of cross-chain communication is optimistic”.\nBut what started the feeding frenzy?\nAnd how were so many able to continue picking the bones?\n\nCredit: samczsun, Zellic.io\nFollowing a routine upgrade in June, the bridge’s Replica contract was initialised with a fatal security flaw leading to the incident. The 0x00 address was set as a trusted root, meaning that all messages were read as valid by default.\nAfter a failed first attempt (costing $350k in gas), the original attacker’s exploit tx, which was copied by those that followed, was able to call the process() function directly, without having first ‘proved’ its validity.\nThe process() function is responsible for the execution of all cross-chain messages and has an internal requirement (line 185) to check the validity of the merkle root of all messages to be processed.\nHowever, the upgrade inadvertently caused transactions with a ‘messages’ value of 0 (invalid, according to legacy logic) to be read by default as 0x00 which was defined in the upgrade as a trusted root, passing the validation requirement as ‘proven’.\nThis meant any process() calls could be executed as valid. In fact, a more sophisticated exploiter could have written a contract to drain the whole bridge for themselves.\nCopycat attackers simply had to copy/paste the same process() function call via Etherscan, swapping out their address in place of the previous exploiter’s.\nThe incident quickly proved to be a chaotic mixture of word-of-mouth crowdhacking, frantic whitehat activity and MEV-bot carnage.\nFor example, 🍉🍉🍉.eth managed to extract a total of $4M from the bridge, but fortunately claims to be acting as whitehat:\n\nHowever, other names stood out for the wrong reasons. There was a notable repeat offender in the Rari Capital (Arbitrum) exploiter from April’s article, who got away with almost $3M in stablecoins, which went straight into Tornado Cash.\nOf the multiple exploiters, the top three addresses (with 95M between them) are the following:\n0x56D8B635A7C88Fd1104D23d632AF40c1C3Aac4e3 ($47M)\n0xBF293D5138a2a1BA407B43672643434C43827179 ($40M)\n0xB5C55f76f90Cc528B2609109Ca14d8d84593590E ($8M)\nA full list of exploiter addresses is available here.\n\nThe project completed a Quantstamp audit in June, with issue QSP-19 foreshadowing a similar vulnerability:\n\nThe auditor’s remarks that “We believe the Nomad team has misunderstood the issue” speak to a worrying attitude towards security that the project docs’ “Long-Term Security” plan appears to confirm:\n\nConcerns were also raised around the response time of the team facing a live and public exploit; the team’s official acknowledgement came three hours after the exploit began.\nThe exploit was eventually halted by simply “removing the Replica contract as owner”, but after such a delay it was too late to save the funds.\nBlockchains may be closed systems, but alt L1 are only as strong as their weakest link.\nThe Harmony chain is still in disarray since its bridge lost $100M in late June, in an attack linked to the Lazarus Group.\nWhat will the future hold for the ecosystems affected by Nomad’s collapse?\nSo far, Moonbeam’s TVL has dropped from $300M to $135M, EVMOS’s from ~$7M to ~$3M, and Milkomeda’s from $31M to $20M.\nBut crucially, the loss of confidence may prove to do far more damage than the missing $190M.\nBuilding in an nascent, experimental industry is tough, and cross-chain infrastructure has many moving parts to secure. The damage done by bridge attacks are often the most painful, as they can contaminate a whole ecosystem, or more.\nBut nomadic liquidity has no permanent home, users will always roam to new lands in search of the “next big thing”, and will continue to get stung whenever vigilance becomes stretched too thin.\nWith each of the 100 entries on the rekt.news leaderboard, the industry learns a harsh lesson, slowly growing stronger.\nBut for now, DeFi still has plenty of easy prey…\n…and scavengers continue to circle overhead.\nWill it ever change?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Cefi and OTC operations are not affected\nWe are solvent with twice over that amount in equity left\nThe firm’s CEO states that the use of the vanity address was for “gas savings” rather than aesthetics… an expensive choice.\nLast time Wintermute got rekt, the exploiter returned (most of) the funds.\nWill they stay lucky this time around?\n\nHacker’s address: 0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705\nAttack contract: 0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26\nMain attack tx: 0xedd31e2a…\nSecond attack tx: 0xc253450f…\nThe likely cause of the hack was a weakness in the Profanity tool used for creating vanity addresses. Following last week’s revelation of the Profanity vulnerability, $3.3M was drained from various wallets by 0x6AE09A… over the following days.\nBoth Wintermute’s hot wallet and DeFi vault contract appear to have vanity addresses, with multiple leading zeros. The hot wallet’s private key was likely compromised and used to drain the vault.\nThough the weak security of Profanity-generated addresses only came into the spotlight recently, the issue was raised on the project’s GitHub back in January.\nAs described by Mudit Gupta:\nThe vault only allows admins to do these transfers and Wintermute’s hot wallet is an admin, as expected. Therefore, the contracts worked as expected but the admin address itself was likely compromised.\nAround the time that the disclosure happened, Wintermute removed all ether from this admin address which suggests that they realized it might have been vulnerable. However, they forgot to remove the address as an admin from their vault.\nThe stolen funds were mostly various stablecoins, totalling $118.4M. The majority of these were deposited into Curve’s 3pool, presumably in an attempt to avoid any blacklisting.\nThe exploiter is now the 3rd largest holder of 3CRV with over 13% of the supply.\nTornado 3pool?\nThe remaining loot is comprised of 671 WBTC (~$13M) and 6,928 ETH ($9.4M) and a variety of other tokens. At the time of writing, the attacker’s address is worth approximately $162.3M.\nWhile Wintermute’s statement assures that “there shouldn’t be a major selloff of any sort”, certain tokens with smaller marketcaps are exposed to a potential dump, with up to 21% of circulating supply taken in the hack:\nThe majority of assets haven’t yet been swapped. Could the hacker be looking to negotiate a white-hat reward?\n\nShortly after the news broke, the launch of a honeypot token, WinterMuteInu, was spoofed from the exploiter’s address to capitalise on all those watching for signs of movement. The scammer seeded a Uniswap pool with 35 ETH of liquidity, which has so far accumulated ~ 166 ETH (~ $225k).\nToday’s incident marks the first major hack since the sanctioning of Tornado Cash last month. Assuming Wintermute don’t manage to retrieve the funds, it will be interesting to see how the funds are laundered.\nPost-Tornado sanctions, the potential use of 3pool as a replacement mixer should be of some concern to all Curve users.\nBut for now, stay humble…\n\n\nIf you enjoy our work, please consider donating to our Gitcoin Grant.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

At the time of the first incident, it hadn’t been drained in approximately 2 months.\nWith over 200k COMP (~$68M) inside the Reservoir, the Compound team could only wait and hope that nobody would discover that the damage was far from done.\nAs they waited for Proposal 64 to pass, which contained a fix for the original bug, Robert Leshner and the team had a tense week ahead.\nHowever, just three and a half days after the initial event, the secret was out, the Comptroller had been refilled, and another $68.8M was sent to the vulnerable vault.\nAs Banteg wrote;\nIf you tally the initial $80m, $22m already claimed after the drip and the $45m currently at risk, the bug tallies to $147m.\n\nAlthough this was more of a “bank error” than an exploit, it’s only fair that Compound takes a place on our leaderboard, where we can see that this case is not without precedent.\nIn the case of the failed Alchemix experiment, we saw the protocol suffer a ~$6.5M loss due to their own mistake.\nLike Leshner, Alchemix appealed for their users to return the funds, however, they were more successful in doing so.\n55% of the Alchemix funds were returned, an amount which currently seems unachievable for Compound.\nIt’s no surprise that users are more likely to do the “right thing” when “asked nicely”, rather than threatened with the authorities.\n\nIn Curve Wars, we remembered when Robert Leshner said;\nCrying to meatspace courts deeply undermines the “code is law” principles that DeFi was founded on.\nIf you want courts and politicians to protect and control you, there is “finance”. If you want a system that is resilient, self-sufficient, open, and upgradable, there is DeFi.\nNow we compare those words to his aggressive appeal;\nIf you received a large, incorrect amount of COMP from the Compound protocol error:\nPlease return it to the Compound Timelock (0x6d903f6003cca6255D85CcA4D3B5E5146dC33925). Keep 10% as a white-hat.\nOtherwise, it's being reported as income to the IRS, and most of you are doxxed.\nWas this a threat or an offer? Return the 'stolen' money and keep a clean 10%, or pay 40% to the IRS and keep a clean 60%...\nThese nonsensical threats might have done more damage to Compound’s reputation than the multi-million dollar loss.\nLeshner has since apologised for his words, but can his reputation be repaired?\nIt’s still not clear how (or if) the existing legal and financial systems will cope with the new concept that is decentralised finance, but for now...\nIf you truly want DeFi, then you have to accept the responsibility that comes with it.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The yUSD was then deposited into Yearn’s yUSD strategy.\nBy using the yUSDVault tokens from Yearn as collateral on CREAM, the attacker then could mint ~$500M of crYUSD.\nWith address B, the hacker then took a flash loan from AAVE worth $2B in ETH, to use as collateral on CREAM. This allowed for borrowing a further ~$500M of yUSD, which was deposited again in order to mint crYUSD.\nThe two accounts then performed a loop of depositing and borrowing, with B transferring ~$500M in yUSDVault tokens to A each time, until account A was in possession of ~$1.5B in crYUSD and ~$500M yUSDVault.\nThe attacker then exploited a vulnerability in CREAM’s internal PriceOracleProxy of yUSDVault tokens. The price of yUSDVault depends on its pricePerShare, which is defined by the vault’s yUSD balance / totalSupply yUSDVault.\nBy redeeming ~$500M yUSDVault for the underlying yUSD, the attacker was able to decrease the vault’s totalSupply to just $8M. Combining this depletion with a deposit of ~$8M in yUSD into the vault led CREAM to increase the value of yUSDVault shares by approximately a factor of two.\nDue to the price manipulation, CREAM now sees address A as having $3B crYUSD in collateral. $2B of this was withdrawn in ETH in order to repay B’s flash loan while the ~$500m of yUSD redeeming from the yUSDVault pays off A’s DAI loan.\nThe $1B left over was more than enough to drain (borrow and default) CREAM’s $130M assets available for lending.\n\nFollowing the attack, funds were pulled from the exploit contract back to this wallet which had been funded by Tornado Cash around 30 mins before the attack in two transactions: one, two.\nSince the attack, the hacker has been using the renBridge to send funds to BTC as well as adding over $40M CRETH2 in single-sided liquidity to Uniswap’s ETH-CRETH2 pool, presumably in an attempt to offload as much as possible as CRETH2 may be salvageable.\n\nThe Cream.Finance: Deployer is amongst the many accounts who have tried to communicate with the hacker.\nTheir message;\nyou win. we're rekt. please return funds and we will honor a 10% bounty.\nWhen experienced attackers make moves like this, the motives are not just financial.\nThis is manipulation of the industry as well as the markets, and we must consider who stands to benefit.\nOther protocols were named in a mysterious message in the main exploit transaction’s input data;\ngÃTµ Baave lucky, iron bank lucky, cream not. ydev : incest bad, dont do\nIn Mudit Gupta’s Observations and Theories about the attack, he points out several reasons why he believes the hacker, (or hackers) to be experienced DeFi developers, and how it is not the average black hat attack.\nThis hack revealed not only vulnerabilities in project code, but deeper rivalries that may not have been apparent for the average DeFi user.\nA once hidden war is now being fought in public.\nA $130M hack gets headlines, but for many, this attack will be remembered not for the loss, but for how it was used as a campaign tool by opposing teams, neither of which have come out on top.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The affected protocols, BonqDAO and AllianceBlock (whose ALBT token was used in the exploit), both confirmed the hack in the following hours.\nDespite all the action being visible on-chain, BonqDAO telegram admins attempted to downplay the incident whilst the team presumably worked out what had happened.\nFUD and spam will not be tolerated\nrekt.news reckons: “using instant price feeds for collateral valuation will not be tolerated.”\n\nCredit: Peckshield, Beosin\nAttacker’s address: 0xcacf2d28b2a5309e099f0c6e8c60ec3ddf656642\nExample attack tx: 0x31957ecc…\nAttacked smart contract: 0x8f55d884cad66b79e1a131f6bcb0e66f4fd84d5b\nSamczsun summarised the attack as follows:\nthe attacker said \"btw 1 ALBT = 5 billion MATIC now\" and Bonq said \"ok\"\nThe hacker was able to manually update the Tellor price feed of (wrapped) WALBT collateral by staking 10 TRB tokens (worth just ~$175).\nThe attacker then used the submitValue function to report WALBT price to the oracle and, because BonqDAO uses the instant value, the attaker was able to borrow against their inflated collateral within the same tx.\n\nFirstly, the ALBT price was raised, allowing the attacker to mint 100M BEUR, Bonq’s Euro-pegged stablecoin against 0.1 WALBT collateral.\nThen, in a subsequent transaction, the WALBT price was reset to extremely low, allowing the attacker to liquidate user’s WALBT collateral, and netting approximately 113M WALBT.\n\n\nBeosin provided a step-by-step:\nThe attacker calls the depositStake function of the TellorFlex contract, depositing 10 $TRB. Why 10 TRBs? We can see that the takeAmount is exactly 10*10^18\nNext, the hacker calls the submitValue function to submit a request to change the $WALBT price. The function determines if the caller's stake amount has reached the pre-set takeAmount, which is why the attacker needs to first stake 10 TRB tokens (10^18 is decimal point).\nThis function will record the price submitted by the caller, in this case 50000000000000000000000000000000.\nAfter the price is set, the hacker calls the createTrove function of the Bonq contract to create the trove(0x4248FD) contract, which is a contract of data recording, borrowing and liquidating. Next, the attacker stakes 0.1 $WALBT to the contract to perform a borrowing operation.\nNormally, the borrowing amount should be < 0.1 WALBT to ensure collateral rate in a safe range. But in this contract, the calculation of the collateral value is via TellorFlex contract. The attacker has already raised $WALBT price, thus being able to borrow 100M $BEUR.\nThe hacker sets $WALBT to a low price in 2nd TX. When the $WALBT price is extremely low, the stake rate of WALBTs staked by other users will be at liquidation, enabling hacker to liquidate $WALBT staked by other users at low cost, eventually obtaining ~114M WALBT.\n—\nLosses have been widely reported to be up to $120M, using the tokens’ prices at the time of the hack. But low liquidity meant the attacker has only managed to swap the loot to around $1.7M worth of ETH and DAI, so far.\nNevertheless, the damage to BonqDAO was brutal, with TVL drained from ~$13M yesterday to just over $100k at the time of writing.\nStolen BEUR was dumped on Polygon for just over $500K. Funds were then sent to the attacker’s Ethereum address, where the ALBT was repeatedly dumped for ETH. The attacker’s ETH address currently holds 711 ETH (~$1.2M) and 535k DAI, as well as 89M ALBT (supposedly worth ~$3M, if the attacker can find somewhere to sell it…).\nBlockSec provided a detailed flowchart of funds, which can be found here. The attacker’s ETH address was funded via Tornado Cash shortly before the attack, and the stolen funds have since been deposited back into the mixer.\n\nOmniscia’s audit of BonqDAO raised concerns over “multiple vulnerabilities as well as core design flaws”.\nAccording to Omniscia's post-mortem, BonqDAO decided to:\nnot move forward with the implementations audited at the time, opting to integrate Chainlink oracles in the future.\nThe Bonq Protocol has introduced numerous updates since the time the audit was finalized, including all contracts involved in the vulnerability (ConvertedPriceFeed, ChainlinkPriceFeed, and TellorPriceFeed). These contracts were never in scope of any audit conducted by the Omniscia team and thus are considered to be unaudited code.\nWhile it may have been BonqDAO had the vulnerability, AllianceBlock has suffered significant collateral damage from this incident.\nThe sell-off of Bonq users' liquidated ALBT caused its price to dump up to ~75% following the attack. AllianceBlock have stated they will reissue the token and airdrop to users based on a Snapshot from before the hack.\nBonq’s Euro stablecoin, BEUR, has dropped to approximately 25% below its peg and the price of the DAO’s token, BNQ, has also taken a hit of over 30%.\nAllianceBlock may not be at fault for the vulnerability, but perhaps they need to work on their due diligence.\nIt may not be the most exciting part of DeFi, but it’s surely amongst the most important.\nIf AllianceBlock wants to achieve their aims of “seamlessly bring[ing] DeFi and TradFi together”, maybe they should take a more TradFi approach to due diligence.\nBut it looks like it may already be too late for Bonq.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Starting from 00:00:23 UTC on 2.12.2021, the attacker used this stolen trust to fill their own wallet.\nAs the news of users’ addresses being drained reached Badger, the team announced they had paused the project’s smart contracts, and the malicious transactions began to fail around 2 hours 20 mins after they had begun.\nBadgerDAO’s aim is to bring Bitcoin to DeFi. The project is made up of various vaults for users to earn yield on wrapped BTC variants on Ethereum.\nThe vast majority of stolen assets were vault deposit tokens which were then cashed out, with the underlying BTC bridged back to the Bitcoin network, and any ERC20 tokens remaining on Ethereum.\nThe current locations of the stolen funds is summarised here.\nRumours that the project’s Cloudflare account was compromised have been circulating, as have other security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe approvals presented themselves when users attempted to make legitimate deposit and reward claim transactions, building a base of unlimited wallet approvals that allowed the attacker to transfer BTC related tokens directly from the user’s address.\nThe first instance of approvals for the hacker’s address was almost two weeks ago, according to Peckshield. Anyone interacting with the platform since then, may have inadvertently approved the attacker to drain funds.\nOver 500 addresses have approved the Hacker’s address: 0x1fcdb04d0c5364fbd92c73ca8af9baa72c269107\nCheck your approvals and revoke here: etherscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker\nExample transaction: draining ~900 byvWBTC, worth over $50M. The victim had approved the attacker’s address to spend unlimited funds via the increaseAllowance() function around 6 hours earlier.\n\nEventually, thanks to an “unusual” feature in Badger’s transferFrom() function, the team was able to pause all activity, halting the further loss of funds.\n\nIf longstanding projects with such strong reputations as Badger can get rekt like this, and some of the biggest names in the game have their near-misses, DeFi users can’t afford to get too comfortable about the security of their biggest bags. Diversification is key to survival.\nDespite all the stress that’s usually placed on checking the URL and making sure you’re interacting with proper channels, this wouldn’t have helped users in this case.\nThe front-end was manipulated at least 12 days ago.\nHow did Badger not notice?\nA user flagged the suspicious increaseAllowance() approval in Discord.\nWhy did Badger devs not look into it?\nFor experienced users, these kinds of bogus approvals might be easy to spot, and checking the validity of any contract is easy enough by copy/pasting the address into Etherscan before signing the transaction.\nBut for DeFi to reach “mass adoption”, these extra precautions must be streamlined.\nUntil then, we can only practise good wallet and approval hygiene.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

While the MNGO price remained high, the attacker was able to drain the lending pools using the unrealised profit from the long position as collateral.\nThe attacker’s Mango Markets account displays a $115M shortfall. The borrowed assets are listed below:\n\nThe extreme price manipulation was made possible by the MNGO token’s low liquidity and volume. After some mixed messaging, Mango Markets later clarified that the incident was not an oracle failure, but rather genuine price manipulation.\nIn the process of pumping the price, over 4000 short liquidations were caused and as a result of the collapse of the protocol, the Solana network’s TVL is down over 20%.\n\nThe attack drained all of Mango Markets’ available borrow liquidity, with $70M remaining in the treasury. This leaves a shortfall of approximately $50M to cover the bad debt left by the incident, which the hacker is proposing to return.\nThe governance vote on the hacker’s proposal is on-going and, of course, the attacker voted yes with all of their stolen 32M votes:\n\nThe hackers proposal would allow users to be made whole and the protocol to become functional again, essentially starting from scratch. And by the looks of Mango Markets’ stated priorities, it sounds like taking the offer would check all their boxes…\nBut surely this behaviour can’t be rewarded with a “bounty” of ~$65M, the total of remaining USDC, BTC, USDT, and SRM?\nHow “binding” is a DAO vote? With no existing laws in regards to DeFi governance proposals, this story will set a precedent.\nIf the token governance vote system remains in use, then there will surely be more hostile takeovers, if not from hackers, then from competing organisations. These events already happen in traditional finance, but DeFi, or regulators, will have to prepare their own method to defend their governance systems from potential bad actors.\nIf only Mango had paid out a bounty in March, and prevented the attack from happening in the first place…\nA similar attack on Venus Protocol last year (not to be confused with the more recent incident related to the Luna fallout) led to a user raising concerns within the Mango community over six months ago.\n\nWith so much advance notice, why wasn’t this attack averted?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Since then, aside from downplaying the incident (“less than 1% of our monthly active users have been affected/reported”), the team have not stated what caused the hack.\nDo they even know themselves?\nThe hack reportedly affected both desktop and mobile users, whose addresses were targeted on 13 chains.\nThe addresses were drained via a three step system. Firstly, a direct transfer into a new address, where tokens were then swapped for the chain’s native asset and consolidated in a third wallet.\nTracing the funds (spearheaded by ZachXBT and Tayvano) looks to have been a painstaking task, relying on individual user reports, and linking the above process to addresses which provided gas to the accounts in question.\nSome funds ($1M) have apparently been recovered, but the method is being kept quiet for now. And while some spend time helping victims, others look to capitalise on their desperation with a fake ‘refund’ airdrop.\nThe laundering of funds has shown patterns attributed to the Lazarus Group, being sent to the Sinbad BTC mixer (formerly Blender), a DPRK favourite.\n\nWhile the root cause is still to be identified, the hack may be linked to a BGP hijacking of Atomic Wallet traffic.\nBGP has played a part in a number of crypto incidents in the past. While this technique is not enough on its own to carry out the heist, it may have been combined with the vulnerabilities alluded to (though never specifically disclosed) by Least Authority, who faced legal pressure to take down their blog post.\nA leak of logged sensitive data, such as was the case with the Slope wallet incident on Solana, is another possiblity. Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin has also listed some potential scenarios.\nWhatever the cause, the attitude of the Atomic Wallet team was summed up by Tayvano:\nYour security posture sucks, you refuse to listen to people, you aggressively silence people, and your products and services facilitate theft on a daily basis and have for years.\nWithout knowing a root cause, other wallet providers will be having a hard time checking if they might be susceptible to the same attack vector.\nWith plenty of shady looking options out there, it’s better to be safe than sorry.\nWhen it comes to securing your assets, any hint of a red flag should be reason enough look elsewhere.\nAnd Atomic Wallet is covered in them.\nWill they ever admit what went wrong?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

HTX had also already been drained of $8M in late September, though funds were recovered around two weeks later.\nYesterday, all eyes (including Justin’s) were on CZ and Binance’s settlement with US authorities.\nBut His Excellency makes sure to never stay out of the spotlight for long…\nWith increasing regulatory pressure on crypto’s main players, this repetitive-rektage couldn’t have come at a worse time for Sun.\nOr are these repeated “hacker attacks” just building a rainy-day fund, ready for a life on the lam?\n\nCredit: Peckshield, Cyvers\nTwo hours after the first alerts of fund movements on HECO then HTX, Sun acknowledged the attacks, promising to compensate the HTX losses:\nHTX and Heco Cross-Chain Bridge Undergo Hacker Attack. HTX Will Fully Compensate for HTX's hot wallet Losses. Deposits and Withdrawals Temporarily Suspended. All Funds in HTX Are Secure, and the Community Can Rest Assured. We are investigating the specific reasons for the hacker attack. Once we complete the investigation and identify the cause, we will resume services.\nThe HECO Bridge funds were drained via a compromised operator account, which (beginning at 09:59 AM UTC) withdrew funds from the bridge to the attacker’s address. The majority of funds were forwarded onto an accumulation wallet.\nThe compromised HTX hot wallet addresses (ETH, others) transferred funds (beginning at 10:41 AM UTC) directly to separate attacker addresses (ETH, others).\nWhile the precise source of the attacks is unknown, it seems likely that vulnerabilities exploited in previous hacks could have been reused, given the connections between the affected entities.\nPeckshield puts the HECO bridge losses at $86.6M, in the following assets: 42M $USDT, >10k ETH ($19M), 489 HBTC ($18.8M), 347M SHIB ($2.8M), 173k $UNI ($930k), 619k USDC, 42k $LINK ($600k), 347k TUSD.\nCyvers summed $12.5M in losses from HTX, made up of: 1,240 ETH ($2.5M), 7.3M USDT, 1.78M USDC, and 62.2K $LINK ($870k).\nHECO attacker address: 0xfc146d1caf6ba1d1ce6dcb5b35dcbf895f50b0c4\nCompromised operator address: 0x3d655889d197125fb90dcb72e4a287a8410ed1b9\nHECO Bridge address: 0xa929022c9107643515f5c777ce9a910f0d1e490c\nHTX hot wallet 1 (ETH): 0xb9f775179bcc7fcf4534700a48f09c590e390ead\nHTX hot wallet 2 (other assets): 0x9281035df6f00557c0285d7df21d323c2e2f99ad\nHTX attacker 1 (ETH): 0x5a22f867dfcb4f32d25a5fa365b9d9d78d5515dc\nHTX attacker 2 (other assets): 0x121a0ff24027fffcdd0ae008da82f2789c7945cc\nAfter receiving, funds were forward on to various further addresses; Hacken provided a list.\n\nThis style of attack targeting CEX and bridges has all the hallmarks of DPRK’s Lazarus Group, who’ve cleared over half a billion dollars in the last six months alone.\nOnce they find a foothold, insufficient spring cleaning is sure to result in more losses.\nRegardless of who carried out the double-pronged hack, costs are mounting up for Justin Sun, who may be next in line for the US authorities’ ongoing crypto cleanse.\nHECO and HTX are the 3rd and 4th incidents inside three months on Sun-linked projects, totaling 233M in losses (with just $8M returned, so far).\nEarlier this month, we wondered:\nHow deep do Sun’s pockets go?\nAt this rate, perhaps one day we'll find out?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The protocol’s mBTC, mETH, mDOT and mGLXY were drained, totalling ~$2M for the attacker.\nAfter news of the exploit over the weekend, the oracle was successfully fixed, but the problems didn't stop there.\nAll mAssets (Mirror-wrapped stocks) were still for the taking, unable to be traded until markets opened following the long-weekend. The worry was that the previously stolen funds would be used to snap up the remaining, vastly-undervalued mAssets.\nHowever, with just minutes to spare before markets opened on Tuesday, the stolen funds were disabled for use as collateral, saving what remained of the protocol.\n\nThe fact that a $90M exploit went unnoticed by users (and probably the devs), is symptomatic of the recklessness associated with the failings around the Terra ecosystem.\nThe simplicity of the vulnerabilities seems out of place when compared with the damage that has been done. Firstly, $90M was lost to a basic logic bug, and then, the rushed fork led to the oversight of a very foreseeable oracle issue.\nEven in the face of these failures, Luna 2.0 is pumping and, despite having lost billions of dollars of other people's money, Do Kwon remains as arrogant as ever.\nIn his rush to repair his reputation, Kwon is taking advantage of all those who are stuck fighting sunk-costs; the developers who invested their time, and retail, who invested their savings.\nDeFi today feels like it has lost a sense of purpose. Our reputation is damaged, and even the keenest users have less confidence.\nWe may have advanced our methods of wealth distribution, but our moral compass clearly still needs an update.\nImagine our industry without all the ego… How much of this damage could have been prevented?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

It is now paused, so no further action is needed.\nThe team didn’t take long to address the issue and paused the pools that were under attack.\nWooFi, self described as “One Dex to rule all chains”, they offer single-sided yields, cross-chain swaps, perps trading and revenue sharing.\nLooks like they’re the ones who got ruled, doesn’t it?\n2024 is off to a hot start for Arbitrum attacks, with Radiant Capital, Gamma Strategies and Seneca already getting hit.\nNow that bull season is back, will 2024 make 2023 look like a giant wrestling a midget?\n\nCredit: Spreek, Peckshield, Nick L. Franklin, WooFi\nOne of the WOOFi oracles on Arbitrum was exploited using flash loans, which manipulated the price of WOO in order to repay the flash loans at a cheaper price.\nThe attacker manipulated the Woo price to drain funds from the WooPPV2 pool contract. Then drained the pool using the swap function 3 times, stealing about $8.5 million.\nThe exploit was caught and contracts paused within 13 minutes. The attacker still managed to get away with a big stash of ETH.\n\nAttacker’s address:\n0x9961190b258897bca7a12b8f37f415e689d281c4\nAttack tx:\n0x40e1b8c78083fc666cb7598efcecd0ae0af313fc41441386e4db716c2808ce07\nAttack contract:\n0xD4c633C9A765bC690E1FbA566981c1F4eab52dF0\nAttack Flow:\n\nThe stolen funds were sent to this address.\nWoofi sent an onchain message to the attacker, assuming a whitehat executed the exploit and offered a 10% bounty.\nWoofi issued a post-mortem and highlighted the exploit:\nIn WOOFi v2, the sPMM system adjusts oracle prices based on trade value to manage slippage and balance pools. However, an error led to a price adjustment outside the expected range and the fallback check, normally executed against Chainlink and didn't cover the WOO token price.\nThe recent addition of a lending market for WOO on Arbitrum, plus relatively low liquidity support for WOO tokens elsewhere on the network, made the exploit economically feasible.\nJust because your code is audited isn’t a guarantee. Certik most recently audited WOOFi's swap and oracle contracts in October 2022.\nImmunefi also held a bug bounty in 2022-3 that included their Wooracle. Although the results don’t seem to be public.\nOracle manipulation and flash loan attacks were not excluded.\nWoofi went live on Arbitrum in November 2022, looks like somebody found a bug.\n\nWoofi said this was their first incident. But going cross-chain has its risks.\nThese risks are becoming more common as we connect more networks across the chains.\nThe attack on Woofi underscores the importance of robust security measures, thorough testing, audits, bug bounties and a keen understanding of the complexities of cross-chain operations.\nThe recent addition of a lending market for WOO on Arbitrum, coupled with relatively low liquidity, created a fertile ground for exploitation.\nHaving a novel oracle design that is not widely used, battle-tested and proven to be a cross-chain solution should serve as a reminder not only for Woofi, but any other protocol that tries to reinvent the wheel.\nBragging about your sPMM design a few hours before someone took advantage of it is pretty ironic.\nIs using Chainlink price feeds as a fail safe a good idea?\nGiven some of these circumstances, is it a surprise they were attacked?\nIt's a wake-up call for the DeFi community, reminding us that no system is immune to exploitation, especially in an environment where the stakes are high and the pace of innovation is relentless.\nTime in our space moves fast, but protocols should slow down at times, especially when they are already live and the risks are more dangerous than in a testing environment.\nIt is much better to catch the mistakes in the lab instead of having them revealed in real time, where bad actors and vigilantes can make an example out of you.\nWhile Woofi leads us to believe that it was a whitehat that was behind the attack. At the end of the day, what matters is the fact that they were attacked.\nIt shouldn’t even matter whether it was the good guys or the bad guys.\nDoes it matter if the person who broke your window was a burglar or a neighbor trying to get in?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nFei Rari - rekt.\nBetween approximately 9:00 and 9:35 AM UTC on April 30th, seven of Rari’s Fuse pools were drained for a total of ~$80M.\nDespite claiming “none of the arbitrum pools are vulnerable”, the attack continued on Arbitrum today, though the losses (~100 ETH) were minimal in comparison.\nThis isn’t the first time that Rari has got rekt - lets hope the hackers don’t go for a hat trick.\n\nCredit: Hacxyk, Certik\nRari uses forked Compound code, which doesn’t follow the check-effect-interaction pattern, and has led to a number of re-entrancy incidents: CREAM, Hundred, Voltage/Ola.\nIn this case though, the re-entrancy pattern is via CEther which uses call.value to send ETH. In the case of the receiver being a contract, call.value is able to make another call which can be abused.\nThis vulnerability was reported in early March and mitigated by upgrading the CToken and Comptroller contracts. However, the new re-entrancy protections didn’t cover the function exitMarket within the Comptroller contract.\nexitMarket re-assigns a deposited asset as no longer being collateral, which can then be withdrawn, as long as there is no loan taken against the funds. Given that the checks are made after the transfer (due to Compound code not following check-effect-interaction pattern), the transaction doesn’t record the borrowed amount as debt before the collateral is withdrawn.\nBy using flash loans to borrow ETH, the attacker was able to re-enter via call.value, calling exitMarket in order to withdraw the flash loaned collateral whilst also keeping the borrowed ETH.\n\nStep-by-step using example tx 0xab4860…\n1. Attacker flashloaned 150,000,000 USDC and 50,000 WETH\n2. Deposited 150,000,000 USDC as collateral into the fUSDC-127 contract, which is a vulnerable fork version of the compound protocol.\n3. With deposited collateral, the attacker borrowed 1,977 ETH via the “borrow()” function.\n4. However, the “borrow()” function does not follow the check-effect-interaction pattern. Specifically, it transfers ETH to the attacker’s contract before updating the attacker’s actual borrow records.\n5. Therefore, with the attacker’s borrow record not updated, the attacker made a reentrant call to “exitmarket()” in the fallback function, which allows the attacker to withdraw all his collateral (150M USDC)\n6. The attacker repeated steps 1~5 on multiple other tokens.\n7. Finally, the attacker repaid the flashloan and transferred the rest to their address as profit, and routed some of the funds onward to Tornado Cash.\nAffected Fuse pools: 8, 18, 27, 127, 144, 146, 156\nAttacker’s address (inc. all exploit txs): 0x616275…\nAttack contracts: 0xE39f3C…, 0x32075b…\nArbitrum attack tx: 0x3212d0…\nTotal funds lost:\n6,037.8139071514 eth\n20,251,603.11559831 fei\n14,278,990.684390573 dai\n1,948,952.1788665l lusd\n10,055,556.328173 usdc\n132,959.9008 usdt\n31,615.8714 rai\n13,101,364.94 frax\n2,765,891 ust\nTotal estimated value: $79,749,026\nFollowing the attack, the hacker began depositing the proceeds into Tornado Cash, however stopped after moving just 5400 ETH (~$15M).\nWith the remaining $62.7M still in the wallet, is the hacker considering the offer of a bounty to return the funds?\nTribe DAO seems to be hopeful, as they sent the following message via etherscan.\nWe noticed you may be considering the no-questions-asked $10m offer. If you wish to take us up on this, please deposit the remaining funds to the Tribe DAO Timelock: 0xd51dbA7a94e1adEa403553A8235C302cEbF41a3c\n\nAll Compound forks should take this opportunity to check their code for similar vulnerabilities.\nAs 0x_b1 pointed out:\nthis exploit had been fixed in Compound code some time ago, but was changed to its previous form in this commit by developers\nHopefully the user who asked Rari if the Arbitrum pools were safe was not too badly affected, as they were reassured of their safety by Rari, only to fall victim to the same exploit today.\nA quick check could have prevented the double damage.\nNow Rari shares #10 on the leaderboard.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The attacker called the QBridge deposit function on the ethereum network, which calls the deposit function QBridgeHandler.\n2. QBridgeHandler should receive the WETH token, which is the original tokenAddress, and if the person who performed the tx does not have a WETH token, the transfer should not occur.\n3. tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom(depositer, address(this), amount);\n4. In the code above, tokenAddress is 0, so safeTransferFrom didn’t fail and the deposit function ended normally regardless of the amount value.\n5. Additionally, tokenAddress was the WETH address before depositETH was added, but as depositETH is added, it is replaced with the zero address that is the tokenAddress of ETH.\n6. In summary, the deposit function was a function that should not be used after depositETH was newly developed, but it remained in the contract.\nAccording to Certik’s analysis:\nOne of the root causes of the vulnerability was the fact that tokenAddress.safeTransferFrom() does not revert when the tokenAddress is the zero (null) address (0x0…000).\nDespite not having locked any ETH in the Ethereum contract, the attacker’s BSC address now had access to 77,162 qXETH ($185 million) to use as collateral against loans on Qubit.\nThey used this collateral to borrow WETH, BTC-B, USD stablecoins, and CAKE, BUNNY, and MDX before swapping everything for a total of 200k BNB (~$80M), which remains in the BSC address.\n\nAccording to the Qubit docs, the cross-chain collateral feature was audited in Dec 2021.\nthe whole X-Collateral feature (including contracts and scripts) has been audited by Theori, a professional auditing firm. The audit result is published here.\nThe project has a max bounty of $250k on Immunefi, but the Qubit team seems prepared to negotiate.\nBack in May 2021, we were gifted 100k DAI by the Pancake Bunny hacker.\nWe returned the funds, and told the team “not to lose it this time”, yet here we are again.\nOur donation address is listed below.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

it exposed the fatal flaw in Phemex's multi-chain ambitions.\nAs MetaMask's principal security researcher Taylor Monahan told The Block the sophistication of the attack - simultaneous drains across chains, methodical token swapping prioritizing freezable assets, and manual execution instead of scripted chaos.\nWhile Phemex rushed to reassure users about their cold wallet security, they forgot the first rule of hot wallet management - if you can't secure one chain, maybe don't try securing over a dozen.\nThe team quickly promised a compensation plan would be \"announced soon,\" as if throwing money at the problem could patch their security holes.\nThey might need a bigger compensation fund if they keep treating multi-chain security like a game of whack-a-mole.\nWhen every chain becomes a potential point of failure, is multi-chain support really a feature - or just over a dozen ways to get rekt?\n\nWhether through leaked private keys or compromised access controls, exchange security keeps failing with clockwork precision.\nMulti-chain support sounds fantastic until dozens of different doors swing open simultaneously, inviting thieves to a $73.54 million shopping spree.\nPhemex's hot wallet massacre joins an increasingly crowded club of exchanges who've learned that wallet security isn't just a suggestion - it's an expensive lesson in the art of losing control.\nTime will tell if we discover the full story behind this exploit.\nThough if history is any guide, the root cause of access control and private key breaches has a tendency to remain mysteriously classified.\nIn other words, we don’t always find out the entire story.\nThe details fade but the pattern remains crystal clear\nHot wallet permissions keep failing, transparency remains optional, and exchanges keep pretending they're ready for multi-chain custody.\nWhich chain will leak next - or have exchanges finally mastered the art of losing money across all of them?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Then when Alchemix was also hit, the DeFi community began to panic.\nThis was not just another iteration of the read-only reentrancy bug which has plagued the sector for the past months, despite what Curve initially, and dismissively, assumed.\n\nThe tweet was deleted once it became clear that the problem ran deeper…\n…were more pools at risk?\nAs the nature of the threat became clearer, Curve clarified, stating that the bug affected the alETH/msETH/pETH pools and that:\nOther pools are safe.\nThen Curve itself was hit when the CRV/ETH pool was drained for $24.3M.\nWould this bloody Sunday ever end?\n\nCredit: Vyper, Ancilia, Chaofan Shou, Tayvano\nInitially, the hacks were thought to be due to the read-only reentrancy vulnerability which has damaged countless protocols over the last few months, most recently Conic Finance and EraLend.\nHowever, the exploited contracts were not external projects using Curve pools as a price feed, but the Curve pools themselves…\nThe root cause was in fact a 0-day compiler bug in certain older versions of Vyper, the language Curve’s contracts are written in.\nA misalignment of storage slots between two functions (add_liquidity and remove_liquidity) causes a malfunction in the nonreentrant guard. This allows the attacker/s to re-enter the transaction between these two functions in order to manipulated LP token prices and drain the pool.\n\n\n\nAny pool containing native ETH and written in versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0 was vulnerable.\nThe bug has been exploitable since 2021, and was patched (seemingly by accident, given no protective actions were taken) in version 0.3.1.\nAttacker’s addresses and attack transactions:\nJPEG’D: 0x6ec21d1868743a44318c3c259a6d4953f9978538\nTx: 0xa84aa065…\nAlchemix: 0xdce5d6b41c32f578f875efffc0d422c57a75d7d8\nTx: 0xb676d789… and 0x20d00acd… (whitehat tx)\nMetronome (whitehat frontrunner): 0xc0ffeebabe5d496b2dde509f9fa189c25cf29671\nTx: 0xc93eb238…\nCurve: 0xB1C33b391C2569B737eC387E731E88589e8ec148 and 0xb752def3a1fded45d6c4b9f4a8f18e645b41b324\nTx: 0x2e7dc8b2… and 0x2e7dc8b2...\nDespite not being able to find a workable exploit, Curve has advised users to withdraw from the Tricrypto pool on Arbitrum out of caution.\nThankfully, although being from an older Vyper version, the stETH/ETH pool (>$400M TVL) is fine.\nAs the chaos was unfolding, whitehats rushed to save funds, but were repeatedly pipped to the post by hackers.\n\nSome funds were saved, however, totalling $17M so far, with the Metronome funds likely to be returned (0xc0ffeebabe has already set 1000 ETH aside).\nBut many were frustrated at the perceived irresponsible disclosure of the vulnerability (specifically the at-risk version numbers) while efforts were still on-going.\nBlockSec, who came under fire for publicly reaching out to Curve via Twitter, seem to have a clear conscience and defended their actions as having come after all exploitable pools were drained.\nClout farming should take a back-seat when every second counts.\nAs banteg put it:\nyou 👏 don't 👏 tweet 👏 live 👏 vulns 👏 before 👏 they 👏 are 👏 fully 👏 mitigated\n\nThe losses have been heavy, but the fallout could be worse…\nMany of the associated tokens took a beating: JPEG (initially -45%, since settled around -20%), pETH (initially -85%, then settled at around -40%), ALCX (down <10%), alETH (roughly -20%), CRV currently -15% but dropped to $0.60 at lowest point.\nAnd CRV is the one to watch…\nThe potential impact of such a large amount of CRV being dumped onto the open market (which the hacker still hasn’t done so far…) caused worries due to the highly-leveraged position of the protocol’s founder Michael Ergorov.\nIn a fittingly degen manner, Ergorov has borrowed a total of $107.2M of stablecoins against $284M of CRV collateral across a variety of DeFi lending protocols. But with such a large quantity of CRV hanging in the balance, a liquidation cascade could cause much larger problems than yesterday’s hacks.\nTheories of perverse incentives aside, Ergorov does seem to be maneuvering but remains in a dicey position under pressure from rapidly increasing interest.\nFor the sake of the whole sector let’s hope his good luck continues…\nSome managed to profit from yesterday’s chaos, bots included, but are now being urged to do the right thing (by the alETH hacker no less, maybe hinting at some good news to come for Alchemix).\n\nWhile Curve has made clear that the other protocols were not at fault, it’s hard to know where the blame does ultimately lie.\nCompiler-level vulnerabilities come as a chilling surprise to all involved.\nSituations like these, which at times seemed to present an existential threat to a key piece of DeFi infrastructure, present an opportunity to break from business as usual and reprioritise.\nOne of the most valuable innovations of our system is the transparency which allows us to dissect incidents like these in an open conversation, in stark contrast to TradFi.\nThe tools underlying our industry require just as much attention as the protocols they are used to build. With the majority of attention on Solidity, this vulnerability in Vyper snuck under the radar for years before being exploited.\nBut the incentives are skewed…\nAuditing projects can be good money, but generally takes for granted the stability of the underlying language. And with no token for VCs to dump on retail the base layer can often get forgotten about.\nWith 59 contracts potentially affected, a similar bug in Solidity could see far more widespread damage.\nThis hack took a different approach to most. Not content with ripping off protocols for a million or so going after the same read-only reentrancy, the attacker/s targeted a deeper layer to find a way in.\nThat kind of dedication and attention to detail sounds like a certain state-sponsored hacking group…\nOr perhaps this time the bug was discovered by accident; it’s hard to imagine such a deeply buried vulnerability being painstakingly researched only to get frontrun on execution.\nEither way, this still offers an opportunity to change direction.\nGiven some of the larger protocols in the space have money to burn, and even more to lose, hiring in-house specialists to work on maintain and research could be money well spent.\nBut while money remains attracted to our casino solely by the promise of moonshots, investment in the most basic level of infrastructure will likely continue to be lacking.\nWill we learn this time?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Funds retrieved from dev within a few hours in a rollercoaster ride of a day.\nMunchables was quick to report that they were compromised on March 26, tracking movements and attempting to stop the transactions.\nRumors swirled in the Web3 security community about the possibility that Munchables accidentally hired a North Korean developer who never transferred ownership of the smart contracts back to the team.\nZachXBT went on offense against the rogue dev, in a turn of events that may have saved the day for Munchables and those affected by the exploit.\nThis is the second attack on a Blast protocol in under a week. Super Sushi Samurai was sliced just a few days ago for $4.8M.\nBlast is still a young chain and clearly going through some growing pains, pretty dangerous considering they quickly generated $1.24B TVL, already surpassing Avalanche.\nWill Blast continue their upward trend or could we continue to see further exploits that could threaten the trust and stability of the entire ecosystem?\n\nCredit: ZachXBT, Munchables, Pop Punk, quit.q00t.eth, Pacman\nThe Munchables exploit, resulting in a staggering $62.5M loss, appears to have been meticulously planned by the rogue dev since the initial deployment of the project's smart contract.\nUpon closer investigation by quit.q00t.eth, it was revealed that the Munchables contract was a dangerously upgradeable proxy, and it had been upgraded from an unverified implementation address.\n\nThe Munchables contract was soon upgraded to a new version with appropriate checks to prevent users from withdrawing more than they had deposited.\nHowever, prior to this upgrade, the attacker managed to manipulate the contract's storage slots and assign themselves a deposited balance of 1,000,000 Ether.\n\nThe scammer used manual manipulation of storage slots to assign himself an enormous Ether balance before changing the contract implementation to one that appears legit. Then he simply withdrew that balance once TVL was juicy enough.\nAttacker Address: 0x6e8836f050a315611208a5cd7e228701563d09c5\nContract upgraded March 21: 0xea1d9c0d8de4280b538b6fe6dbc3636602075184651dfeb837cb03f8a19ffc4f\nA few hours after the attack, in an interesting turn of events, ZachXBT, outed the rogue dev.\nFour different devs hired by the Munchables team and linked to the exploiter are likely all the same person. They recommended each other for the job, regularly transferred payments to the same two exchange deposit addresses and funded each other's wallets.\nGithub Usernames:\nNelsonMurua913\nWerewolves0493 (Can no longer be found)\nBrightDragon0719 (Can no longer be found)\nSuper1114\nPayment addresses:\n0x4890e32a6A631Ba451b7823dAd39E88614f59C97\n0x6BE96b68A46879305c905CcAFFF02B2519E78055\n0x9976Fe30DAc6063666eEA87133dFad1d5ec27c5E\nExchange deposit address:\n0x84e86b461a3063ad255575b30756bdc4d051a04b\n0xe362130d4718dc9f86c802ca17fe94041f1cfc77\n11 minutes later, Munchables announced that the developer had agreed to share the keys for the full Munchables funds without any conditions.\nDuo Nine highlighted that ZachXBT scared the rogue dev so much, he gave the keys back.\nRoughly $60.5M funds transferred back to Munchables:\nTransaction 1: 0x69f271f90204ae993200f54676c922fe5ee3e5020a16ae34f589f52d923857f1\nTransaction 2: 0x381d57aa2d959ff9580ad61cc6549ae3c026eed9ee5b2ea10f9601a186c49a13\nTransaction 3: 0x62a148877957cbf1ae89cafa144496d99239ee900a3b90194249e6baaa3ddc2f\nPacman broke the news that the funds had been secured in a multisig by Blast core contributors. He went on to shout out ZachXBT and samczsun for their support behind the scenes.\nThere were rumors within the Web3 community suggesting the rogue dev might be linked to Lazarus, a North Korean hacking group. While there's no official confirmation, this speculation raises intriguing questions about the attacker's motives and methods.\nAnother controversial topic that was floated by the community around the exploit, was the possibility of rolling back the Blast chain, which immediately raised decentralization concerns.\nSince the funds were returned, the chain rollback idea was dead in the water, but the conversation did open up a can of worms.\nThere was an audit completed March 2024 by Entersof. Password for Audit: ESMunc@24!\nNot that the audit helped much with this matter as rogue dev is usually not in the gameplan.\nSome of these exploit stories are filled with villains and victims, with the occasional hero in the mix.\nDid the heroes save the day this time around?\n\nWhat could have been the biggest hack of 2024, ended up being an inside job that did not clearly go as planned thanks to some vigilante justice.\nThe CEO of Pixecraft Studios mentioned giving the dev a trial hire in 2022, which didn’t even last a month, due to the dev being sketchy af.\nAfter that incident, they changed their hiring practices and now collaborate exclusively with trusted recruiters who conduct background checks on candidates. They recommend all crypto teams adopt similar measures to avoid bad actors found on public job boards.\nWhether to dox or not is a hot topic. While the debate over doxxing continues within the crypto community, it's clear that in cases like the Munchables exploit, the practice may serve as a powerful deterrent against malicious actors and protect the integrity of DeFi platforms.\nAs the space evolves, finding a balance between maintaining privacy and ensuring accountability will be crucial in fostering trust among users.\nWith ZachXBT being on the case and already having leads, people chatting about simply modifying chain state or rolling back and the rogue dev having no way to transfer funds without being caught, it is no surprise that the exploiter got checkmated so quickly.\nBut, this situation could have gone in a different direction and things could have gotten uglier than they ended up. What if Blast ended up rolling back the chain, assuming that they even can?\nThis was the 2nd attack on Blast in under a week. It's essential for other protocols on the network to reassess their security measures and remain vigilant against similar threats.\nWill the chain become known as a Blast from the past?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

This is likely due to the fact that the hacker has not yet started to sell their stolen tokens.\nEASY is a relatively illiquid asset, with an average 24hr trading volume of roughly $10m ($43m in the past 24hr).\nThe hacker is now in control of 30% of the total supply, and with little liquidity, there is not much they can do. The founders are also in a tough situation; the EasyFi network has become centralised and controlled by a criminal mind.\nSo the hacker takes the number one place on our leaderboard on paper, and also - have they deserved it?\nThe founder of EasyFi writes that;\nthe compromised machine was not used for daily operations and is used solely for the purpose of official transfers.\nIf these funds were used for “official transfers”, then they must have been part of some kind of treasury. If so, why would a single user or device have access?\nWhy wouldn't these tokens be on a Multisig Wallet and / or be secured by a hardware wallet?\nIf this admin key was secured by nothing more than a MetaMask hot wallet, then there’s little reason for sympathy. Those who are in charge of other peoples funds have no reason to not use maximum security.\nWe await a more detailed post mortem from @AnkittGaur, who will hopefully have more detailed explanations as to how this attack took place.\nIt seems EasyFi is hoping for mercy from their attacker, as they published the following open letter in their “pre-post-mortem”\nOPEN LETTER TO THE HACKER\nYou’ve used very sophisticated techniques to steal a lot of funds from the EasyFi community. EasyFi is a very new project which has received a lot of love & support from its users being the one of early movers on the layer 2 Polygon network.\nWe are still at a very early stage and not in a position to make good all the losses in a personal capacity. We care for our community and shall do everything possible at our end to make good all the losses that happened to our users from this theft. We are in great shock and, believe, so as our users who relied on & supported us since inception.\nAs the founder of the project, I would urge you to be thoughtful of the hard work gone into building EasyFi so far. I request you to consider returning all funds and discuss the possibility of an appropriate bounty to avoid all the legal trouble in the future. We can consider a clean payout to a white hacker worth 1M USD and not attempt any legal proceedings regarding this incident.\n\nThis protocol had thousands of users, yet the founders used a level of OPSEC that would be considered poor even just for an individual.\nAlthough the eventual incident was supposedly caused by an external attacker, EASY token holders were in a precarious situation all along.\nThe (single) admin key was capable of draining all the liquidity with no timelock using the “transfer” function shown below.\n\nPoor OPSEC and a total lack of effort led to this huge loss of funds.\nWho knows how EasyFi will explain the situation, but there is very little they could say that would shift the responsibility.\nWhy would they not use a multisig, or even a hardware wallet?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Credit: 0xdeadf4ce\nThe following funds were removed:\nBefore interacting with Uranium, the attacker sent the minimum amount of each token to pair contracts.\nAfter that, they used a low-level function swap() whose execution should drain both reserves.\nThe Uranium team migrated the contract to v2 about ten days ago, and the old version did not have this bug.\nThe team then decided to update the protocol to v2.1, in which the only significant change is the fix of the above-mentioned bug. The liquidity migration from v2 to v2.1 was supposed to start today.\nSo they added a bug in v2, left it for ten days, and on the day they were due to fix it, it was exploited.\nTo make things even more suspicious, we note that the Uranium contracts repository has been removed from Github.\nCredit :  igor igamberdiev\nDid the Uranium team add in the bug and use the liquidity migration to try and hide it?\nOr did “somebody” “find out” about the bug and exploit it just before the developers managed to fix it?\n\nCross chain hacks are becoming more common.\nThe BSC system is not as closed as it once was. There are multiple bridges out of BSC now, and they’re not all controlled by Binance, meaning CZ can’t blacklist all the addresses and keep the stolen funds on BSC.\nAttackers will steal on one chain and escape to another where they can’t be tracked so easily. Tornado is currently the only DAPP allowing for this kind of exit, but we’ll soon see clones on other chains.\nThe beneficiary of this incident is now sat on $57.2 million of liquid assets, a much more preferable prize than the EASY tokens of our previous article, and one which places them in second place on our leaderboard.\nExploits and rug pulls will slow down, but they’re unlikely to stop completely. Even now, when we have battle tested code such as Curve and Uniswap, users still look to chase higher returns in untested projects, so for now, rug pulls look set to stay.\nOne day hackers will operate on fully private chains where they have no need to escape with their funds, but until then...\nrekt will be watching.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

This led to his personal mnemonic wallet phrase being compromised.\nBefore yesterday's events, the last incident to hit the project was in September 2020, when $8M was taken (and later returned).\nPreviously, in February 2020, bZx fell victim to two attacks, in which $298,000 and $645,000 were lost to the first flash loan based exploits.\nLooks like 4th time’s the charm for bZx.\nGiven their chequered past, when the announcement came yesterday that the “private key controlling the Polygon and BSC deployments was compromised”, the replies were more of exasperation than of shock...\n\"What is this like 4th time?\"\n\"It’s probably time for you guys to just give up on this whole crypto thing. Y’all ngmi.\"\n~10 hours after the initial announcement, bZx published an update stating that one of their devs had fallen victim to a phishing attack, stressing that the code itself hadn’t been compromised...\nWhich was of little comfort for the users who lost their money.\nSlowmist have been keeping a running total of funds lost, which at the time of writing is up to ~$55M.\nIt’s hard to blame the team when the attack is so sneaky. Can bZx recover, or is this their fourth and final fatality?\n\nbZx have issued a preliminary post mortem, detailing the events and containing a list of addresses used by the hacker across Polygon, BSC (1, 2, 3) and multiple Ethereum addresses (primary wallet).\nIn place of the more technically advanced exploits that the protocol has faced in the past, this time the root of the issue was a simple phishing attack.\nSometime before the exploit, a bZx dev was sent a phishing email with an attached Word document containing a malicious macro. Opening this document resulted in the dev having the keys to their personal wallet compromised.\nBut this was not a personal attack. This EOA had control over bZx’s Polygon and BSC deployments.\nThe hacker was therefore able to gain control of the contracts and drain them of BZRX. The code was then updated to enable the extraction of tokens from any wallet which had granted token approvals to the affected contracts.\nCheck your token approvals here: Polygon, BSC\nList of bZx contracts\nDespite bZx’s attempts to convince the community that the damage was contained to just Polygon and BSC, the hacker then sent stolen BZRX to Ethereum to use as collateral and borrow a variety of other assets.\nThough the attacker nets less profit this way, they also find a way around the liquidity problem of attempting to dump such a large quantity of BZRX.\nbZx state that they have reached out to centralised services, requesting that Circle freeze the stolen USDC, while the funds on Binance as well as USDT were quickly frozen.\nThey have also reached out to the hacker offering to “chat and reach an agreement”\n\nThe fact that such a large loss of funds can be attributed to such a simple attack vector is hard to believe, especially for a protocol that has experienced more than their fair share of security issues in the past.\nAnyone in crypto should be expected to be wary, and devs working on high TVL projects especially so. But human error in this case should never have been able to lead to such an enormous loss.\nBut does all the blame lie with the protocol?\nLosing control of contracts due to their being vulnerable to a single EOA security breach is unimaginable for any responsible project, and there is no room for “incompetence or negligence” when $55M is at stake.\nThat being said, it takes an especially callous and greedy hacker to go on to drain individual users’ wallets after having extracted millions.\nSo long rekt readers.\nUntil next time, bZx...\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

This low threshold proved to be Radiant's Achilles' heel.\nThe attacker, demonstrating an alarming level of access, managed to gain control of at least 3 of these signers.\nWith this foothold, they swiftly executed a three-step plan that would make any black hat hacker proud:\nTransfer ownership of the lending pools to their malicious contract\nUpgrade the implementation of the lending pools\nDrain funds from the compromised pools\nDespite Radiant's use of a MultiSig wallet for security, the attacker managed to gain control and execute a meticulously planned exploit.\nThe attack unfolded across multiple chains, with evidence suggesting weeks of preparation.\nThe attacker's first move was to transfer ownership of the Pool Provider contract, which manages Radiant's various lending pools, to a malicious contract.\nThis attack was executed on both BSC and Arbitrum:\nAttack Transaction on BSC:\n0xd97b93f633aee356d992b49193e60a571b8c466bf46aaf072368f975dc11841c\nAttack Transaction on ARB:\n0x7856552db409fe51e17339ab1e0e1ce9c85d68bf0f4de4c110fc4e372ea02fb1\nAttacker Address 1:\n0x0629b1048298AE9deff0F4100A31967Fb3f98962\nAttacker Address 2:\n0x97a05becc2e7891d07f382457cd5d57fd242e4e8\nThe exploiter used DEXs such as 1inch, ParaSwap, PancakeSwap, and Odos to swap for some ETH and BNB, before moving funds to the following wallets.\nStolen funds moved to Address on ARB:\n0x8B75E47976C3C500D0148463931717001F620887\nStolen funds moved to Address on BSC:\n0xcF47c058CC4818CE90f9315B478EB2f2d588Cc78\nThe malicious contract, used as the implementation for the proxy upgrade, was deployed 14 days ago on several chains.\nMalicious Contract on BSC:\n0x57ba8957ed2ff2e7AE38F4935451E81Ce1eEFbf5\nMalicious Contract on ARB:\n0x57ba8957ed2ff2e7AE38F4935451E81Ce1eEFbf5\nThis two-week gap between deployment and execution suggests a carefully orchestrated plan, with the attacker biding their time for the perfect moment to strike.\nInterestingly, blockchain data revealed by Hacken point to an attempted exploit on Arbitrum six days prior to the successful attack.\nFailed Attack on ARB:\n0xab34055320676b35d4c6c5936dabc4101b45eda0d66b94ee02f10a96e8a1dd45\nThis failed attempt provides insight into the attacker's persistence and willingness to refine their approach.\nMoreover, the same malicious contract was deployed on Ethereum and Base, though these weren't utilized in the attack.\nMalicious Contract on ETH:\n0x3C2Bc83Dcd293Cc8a23526A37aaeEdD83eBd62de\nMalicious Contract on BASE:\n0x57ba8957ed2ff2e7AE38F4935451E81Ce1eEFbf5\nThe attacker's ambition wasn't limited to a two-chain heist. Malicious contracts lay dormant on Ethereum and Base, like digital time bombs waiting for their moment.\nIt seems our enterprising hacker had dreams of a cross-chain apocalypse, thwarted only by Radiant's belated realization that they were being gutted like a fish.\nThis wasn't just an attack, it was a master class in DeFi demolition.\nOur \"friend\" came prepared with a Swiss Army knife of exploits, ready to carve up Radiant's entire multi-chain buffet.\nIn this multi-chain feast of vulnerabilities, who's next on the menu?\n\nRadiant Capital's multi-chain dreams have turned into a cross-chain nightmare.\nWith over $53 million evaporating faster than you can say \"not your keys\" the protocol's future looks about as bright as a black hole.\nThis isn't just a flesh wound – it's a full-body amputation.\nRadiant's \"robust\" 3-of-11 multisig turned out to be as secure as a paper lock on a bank vault.\nThe attacker didn't just find a chink in the armor; they waltzed through the front door with VIP access.\nThe hacker's two-week preparation period suggests they had more patience than Radiant had security.\nWhile the protocol was busy expanding across chains, the attacker was meticulously laying out the welcome mat for their own personal heist party.\nRadiant's second major incident this year begs the question: is this a case of lightning striking twice, or just shoddy electrical wiring?\nWith their reputation now resembling Swiss cheese, Radiant faces an uphill battle to regain user trust – if there's anyone left to trust them.\nAs users flee the smoldering ruins of yet another DeFi disaster, will they ever feel safe venturing into multi-chain protocols that forgot to install the guard rails?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nIt’s already been a November to remember… and there’s still a week to go.\nOG decentralised exchange KyberSwap is the latest project to fall victim, getting rekt across six chains for a total loss of over $48M.\nThe project’s concentrated liquidity protocol, KyberSwap Elastic, saw its TVL fall from $71M to under $3M. The losses were spread out as follows: >$20M on Arbitrum, $15M on Optimism, $7.5M on Ethereum, $3M on Polygon, $2M on Base and $23k on Avalanche.\nThis incident brings the total stolen this month to over $300M (so far), including Poloniex ($126M), dYdX ($8M), Kronos Research ($26M), HECO Bridge and HTX ($99M).\nSpreek spotted the hack, which was confirmed within the hour by KyberNetwork:\nAs a precautionary measure, we strongly advise all users to promptly withdraw their funds. Our team is diligently investigating the situation, and we commit to keeping you informed with regular updates.\nHonestly, given that the hacker basically left on-chain instructions, it’s probably best to withdraw from any KyberSwap forks, in case of black hat copycats.\nAs well as playing the Bob Ross of smart contract exploiting, the hacker has some shady connections, but nonetheless claims to be keen to negotiate (after a nap, of course).\nIs this an exhausted grey hat, inspired by a near-miss of a similar (albeit simpler) vulnerability, and finally looking to secure a bounty after over six months of work?\nOr just a bluffing troll?\n\nCredit: 0xdoug, BlockSec\nThe attack, which began shortly before 11 PM UTC last night, targeted KyberSwap Elastic (concentrated liquidity) pools.\nThe exploit involved using flash loans to push asset prices into a region of each pool’s liquidity curve where there was no existing liquidity. Then, by executing extremely precise swaps within this region, the exploiter was able to trick Kyber’s code via a precision error.\nThat shows just how carefully engineered this exploit was. The check failed by <0.00000000001%\nSee 0xdoug’s detailed breakdown here.\nBlockSec defined the route cause as “tick manipulation and double liquidity counting”:\nIn summary, the attackers borrowed a flash loan and drained the pools with low liquidity. By executing swaps and altering positions, they manipulated the current prices and ticks of the victimized pools. Ultimately, the attacker triggered multiple swap steps and cross tick operations, resulting in double liquidity counting and consequently draining the pools.\nExploiter address 1 (ARB, OP, ETH, MATIC, BASE, AVAX): 0x50275e0b7261559ce1644014d4b78d4aa63be836\nExploiter address 2 (ARB, OP, ETH, MATIC, BASE, AVAX): 0xc9b826bad20872eb29f9b1d8af4befe8460b50c6\nExample attack tx (ETH): 0x485e08dc…\nThe attacker used the 0x50275 address for execution and 0xc9b82 address for holding stolen funds across all affected chains. BlockSec’s MetaSleuth provided a map of all the attacks. EigenPhi published a list of all transactions.\nAlthough the hacker also funded their address on Scroll, the attack never went ahead.\nInitial funding came from Tornado Cash on Ethereum (via an intermediary address), which in turn funded the ARB, OP, BASE and (unused) Scroll addresses. MATIC and AVAX funding came from FixedFloat.\nAccording to KyberSwap’s docs, the current version of Elastic had been audited by ChainSecurity and via a Sherlock contest.\n\nThe exploiter clearly has on-chain flair, showing their working via tx event logs throughout the attack, leaving charming comments such as “Step 2, finding liquidity required”, “Is it enough?” and “Raping Now”.\nThey also sent 1000 ETH on Arbitrum to an address associated with the $16M hack of Indexed Finance in October 2021.\nWhile this may be simple misdirection, the move does sound plausibly like the actions of the Indexed hacker, limelight-loving Andean Medjedovic, who has previous in being performatively offensive.\nThe timing is also strange, given the recent (thwarted) governance attack on Indexed Finance’s abandoned treasury. While the fallout is ongoing, the initial attempt appears linked to Lazarus.\nHowever, while many recent hacks have Lazarus written all over them, this incident looks different.\nCandid on-chain easter-eggs and attempts at misdirection aren’t Lazarus’ style; they don’t waste time planting red-herrings.\nInstead, they opt to work openly, relying on complex webs of transactions to bore and confuse investigators, or throw them off the scent.\nAnd if it were Lazarus, they certainly wouldn’t be looking to negotiate…\nWhoever the hacker may turn out to be, it appears that all hope is not lost.\nThe the following on-chain message was sent from the exploiter’s address upon completion of the attack:\nDear Kyberswap Developers, Employees, DAO members and LPs,\nNegotiations will start in a few hours when I am fully rested.\nThank you.\nPerhaps there’s some good news in store for KyberSwap and LPs.\nOr is the attacker just toying with us all?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Please withdraw your funds from pools.

Full details here.\nThe hacker was therefore able to use their token as collateral to mint 2B $CASH.\nPart of the funds were then burned for SaberSwap LP tokens which were cashed out for 10.8M UST and 16.4M USDC, and the remaining 1.97B CASH were swapped for 8.6M UST and 17M USDC on SaberSwap.\nThe majority of funds were bridged back to Ethereum, and swapped for >16k ETH (~$48M) which remains in this wallet.\nFollowing the attack, the exploiter’s SOL address emitted hundreds of transactions of relatively small amounts of USDC to different addresses. And 3 hours after the exploit began, the hacker left the following message via transaction input data:\n“Account with less 100k have been returned. all other money will be donated to charity.”\n\nAs the attacker has handled part of the refund process themselves, perhaps Cashio will decide to continue.\nWe’ll find out for sure in their planned post-mortem.\nShould we believe the charitable claims of the anonymous attacker, or is this just an attempt to dissuade anyone from trying to track them down?\nShitcoins stolen to fund the war effort?\nWe’ll watch the wallet to find out.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

As the funds were removed via access to the hot wallet private key rather than a brute force attack,  this looks to be a possibility.\nAmidst claims that the hacker would have been better off using DeFi instruments such as Curve or Balancer to launder their money, Curve has spoken out to state that decentralised protocols are actually less effective for money laundering than their centralised alternatives.\n\nIt’s not just Ethereum that has been affected by this hack. 1008 BTC were also stolen.\nhttps://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1309668583908061185?s=20\nThe hacker took the opportunity to send a message to the community using BTC.\n“Epic Hack Homie - Not your keys not your coins”\n\nThe crypto community has been responding to the hacker address.\n\nThis is a developing story, and we will be keeping you up to date as it progresses.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nBingX just crapped out to the tune of $44.7 million.\nIn a plot twist that's becoming all too familiar, another centralized exchange found their hot wallets compromised.\nOn September 19th, BingX learned a costly lesson in the dangers of hot wallet management and the persistence of sophisticated hacking groups.\nAs alerts of the exploit spread, observers watched in fascination as the hackers performed their dark magic, siphoning funds across multiple chains with the finesse of a digital David Copperfield.\nMeanwhile, BingX's PR team scrambled to downplay the incident, insisting it was just a \"minor\" setback - because nothing says \"everything's fine\" like hemorrhaging eight figures worth of customer funds.\nIn the wake of this Singaporean crypto tsunami, how many more exchanges need to be drained before \"not your keys, not your crypto\" stops sounding like a broken record and starts becoming common sense?\n\nCredit: Tayvano, Peckshield, BingX, Vivien Lin, Cyvers, SlowMist, Crypto Slate, ZachXBT\nAs with many crypto calamities, it was the ever-vigilant Crypto Twitter that first sounded the alarm.\nTayvano began listing the addresses exploiting BingX, setting off a chain reaction of blockchain sleuthing.\nTayvano's keen observation highlighted the multi-chain nature of the attack, foreshadowing the extent of the damage to come.\nNot to be outdone, blockchain security firm PeckShield chimed in shortly after, alerting BingX to a suspicious $13.6 million outflow from their wallets.\nIt wasn't until roughly an hour later - a lifetime in crypto years - that BingX acknowledged the situation with a vague \"Temporary Wallet Maintenance Notice.\"\nShortly after, BingX's Chief Product Officer, Vivien Lin, took to social media with a more detailed, if not entirely reassuring, statement.\nAccording to Lin, the BingX team detected \"abnormal network access\" at around 4 AM Singapore time, suspecting a hacker attack on their hot wallet.\nThey claimed to have \"immediately started our emergency plan, including the urgent transfer of assets and withdraw suspension.\"\nLin attempted to downplay the severity of the incident, describing it as a \"minor asset loss\" and assuring users that the majority of funds were safely tucked away in cold wallets.\nThe exchange promised to restore withdrawals within 24 hours and hinted at a forthcoming compensation plan.\nMeanwhile, as BingX was busy crafting its PR narrative, Cyvers painted a far more alarming picture.\nThe total damage? An eye-watering $44.7 million across multiple chains according to SlowMist, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, and others.\nMultiple addresses were involved in the exploit, suggesting a coordinated effort or a particularly sophisticated attacker.\nThe digital fingerprints of the heist were scattered across the blockchain, with no less than ten confirmed exploiter addresses and three additional suspected addresses involved in the attack.\nExploiter Address 1:\n0xf7e8033366166f92eb477b7b38e0d47d47b43326\nExploiter Address 2:\n0xb0146aec3593410c8307b570af69adf4d74678b3\nExploiter Address 3:\n0x940362b46faf7df48af1c8989d809f50466b5fca\nExploiter Address 4:\n0x1Dd7dAf089C16856155FeFd7e2170966bb6b3AEE\nExploiter Address 5:\n0x719981cf7D1a1dC681a1cf0C6B1eeeE090D0FEd6\nExploiter Address 6:\n0xf26e64ef4300ca027d2ffedd7d765d7a3906091c\nExploiter Address 7:\n0xb77a4a9678315775c4ba89f18f84f87538e748f5  \nExploiter Address 8:\n0x63dc352ddfc17aa04edac47ce36e186c1e54b02c  \nExploiter Address 9:\n0x49284f0ab5098d7effb3392124903c081d1b9f7e\nExploiter Address 10:\n0xcfc14fa81226074036622976d95897ff84b58d66  \nThe following 3 addresses were suspected to be involved as well and had interactions with the original exploiter addresses.\nSuspected Address 1:\n0xc1B5a00871B89175bDC8F3b0de9Be3b29ffD3729\nSuspected Address 2:\n0x4D9D586567c9feA923c362c35385935Ee7781bf6\nSuspected Address 3:\n0xf36dd342A1D1C63aAddF9a95226349e527917fF3\nThe exact root cause of the exploit remained elusive, leaving room for speculation.\nWas this the result of a sophisticated phishing attack? An inside job? Or perhaps a vulnerability in BingX's security infrastructure that had been lying in wait, ready to be exploited?\nThe attack spoke to a level of complexity that would make even the most hardened cybercriminals tip their hats in grudging respect.\nPiecing together the puzzle, a familiar specter loomed over the investigation.\nHakan Unal, Senior Security Operations Lead at Cyvers, raised eyebrows with a provocative observation.\n“This hacker’s behavior—using multiple wallets to swap altcoins into ETH and BNB before consolidating—is consistent with the tactics we’ve seen in past Lazarus operations.”\nCould this be another notch in the belt of the infamous cyber-criminals, or just a convenient boogeyman for the industry?\nWhile the connection remains speculative, it adds another layer of intrigue to an already complex situation.\nAmidst the flurry of analysis and speculation, blockchain detective ZachXBT dropped a truth bomb that put BingX's victim narrative into sharp perspective.\n\"The second part of your statement is ironic considering BingX is known to be unhelpful to all of the victims who have stolen funds go there from pig butchering scams, indian call scams, and irl thefts. Hopefully your security incident will help you reassess your processes as you are among the worst in that regard.\"\nZachXBT's scathing commentary highlighted a bitter irony: the exchange that had often turned a blind eye to the plight of scam victims now found itself on the receiving end of a massive heist.\nAs BingX scrambles to contain the damage, both financially and reputationally, the community watches with a mix of cynicism and curiosity.\nIs BingX's misfortune a mere blip on the radar, or the harbinger of a larger storm brewing in the world of centralized exchanges?\n\nWith sophisticated techniques at play and whispers of state-sponsored involvement, one has to wonder: are we witnessing the opening salvo of a new, more treacherous season of crypto heists?\nBingX's $44.7 million mishap isn't an isolated incident.\nJust over a week ago, Indodax, another Asian exchange, found itself $25 million lighter courtesy of a similar attack.\nThese back-to-back breaches paint a worrying picture of escalating threats and potentially outmatched defenses.\nAs exchanges scramble to fortify their digital ramparts, users are left questioning the very foundations of centralized crypto trading.\nThe promise of \"institutional-grade security\" starts to sound hollow when millions vanish in the blink of an eye.\nYet, as the cycle of hack, patch, and repeat continues, one can't help but feel a sense of déjà vu.\nAre we stuck in a never-ending game of whack-a-mole with increasingly sophisticated moles, or is this the push needed for a radical rethinking of exchange security?\nAre these exchanges bringing knives to a gunfight, or are the attackers simply that many steps ahead?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Urging users who have created active claims, to please cancel them using the \"End Token Claim\" button to mitigate further losses.\nTouted by Hedgey as “The #1 token vesting and lockup tools.” The platform provides token infrastructure for onchain teams.\nIt appears the lockup tools were not secure enough, as the thieves drained just over $2.1m worth of assets from the Ethereum contract, consisting of USDC, NOBL, and MASA tokens.\nOn the Arbitrum chain, the attacker was able to steal roughly $42.6m worth of BONUS tokens.\nNobleBlocks(NOBL) gave a detailed security report to their community. Bonus Block(BONUS) briefly posted “Our vestings are safe\" and MASA seemed more concerned with hosting Twitter Spaces than informing their community about the exploit.\nAs the dust settles, the big question remains, how did Hedgey's vaunted security fail so catastrophically?\n\nCredit: Cyvers, Hedgey Finance, NobleBlocks, Blocksec\nOn April 19, Hedgey Finance was exploited across a series of transactions, which resulted in a loss of $2.1 million on the Ethereum Mainnet and $42.6 million worth of assets on the Arbitrum network, totaling approximately $44.7 million.\nThe root cause of the exploit is the lack of input validation on users' parameters, which allowed the attacker to manipulate and gain unauthorized token approvals.\nThe attacker took a flash loan of $1.3 million USDC from Balancer to abuse and manipulate the claimLockup parameter within the createLockedCampaign function of the exploited contract to trick this vulnerable contract into approving USDC token transfer to the attack contract.\n\nIn the second step, the attacker used the approval to transfer USDC to themselves.\nExecuting in two separate transactions, likely to prevent being front-run by bots.\nAfter checking the commit records of the vulnerable contract, the root cause was confirmed to be Unverified User Input; there was less verification of the parameters passed by users, resulting in tokens being approved to the attacker's contract.\n\nExploiter’s address on Ethereum:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xded2b1a426e1b7d415a40bcad44e98f47181dda2\nAttack Contract on Ethereum:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xc793113f1548b97e37c409f39244ee44241bf2b3\nExploited Contract on Ethereum:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xbc452fdc8f851d7c5b72e1fe74dfb63bb793d511\nExploiter’s address on Arbitrum:https://arbiscan.io/txs?a=0xc7241e27ee4b8d32b59a10e848b48530047a8c5b\nAttack Contract on Arbitrum:https://arbiscan.io/txs?a=0xbb52f1723ddf2c84ba2668f4e04712f572cbf780\nExploited Contract on Arbitrum:\nhttps://arbiscan.io/address/0xbc452fdc8f851d7c5b72e1fe74dfb63bb793d511\nFunds are currently being held here.\nHedgey sent an onchain message to the attacker looking to get in touch and discuss next steps. They’re assuming it is a white hat and even told them “well done” for finding the exploit.\nThanks for robbing us, you’re one of the good guys, right?\nConsensys Diligence audited Hedgey’s Token Lockup and Vesting Plans in June and July of 2023.\nWhether it was a white hat or a black hat, doesn’t matter, someone still made away with $44.7 million.\nIsn’t calling theft \"well done\" an insult to every user whose funds were compromised?\n\nWhile Hedgey praises the attacker's skills and holds out hope they are a white hat actor, the nearly $45 million reality check exposes alarming gaps in their security practices.\nHedgey Finance faces an uphill battle to rebuild trust, beginning with a comprehensive security overhaul.\nIt may be a good idea to execute a complete security revamp, fortifying input validation, reinforcing access controls, and enduring stringent audits to prevent history from repeating itself.\nWith millions of dollars lost and trust shaken, the path to recovery will be a long and challenging one.\nBy scrutinizing its security practices and learning from these costly mistakes, Hedgey can begin the arduous journey towards rebuilding its reputation and restoring faith within the decentralized finance community.\nThe decentralized finance landscape is a breeding ground for innovation but also presents a constant reminder that the stakes are high, and the consequences of negligence can be dire.\nFor Hedgey, this exploit serves as a cautionary tale and a reminder that security must always be the top priority.\nThe question remains: can Hedgey redeem itself and regain the trust of its users or will this event forever taint its standing in the world of DeFi?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Then came another round of transactions, with a further $25.6M lost on BSC and Polygon.\nThe platform took four and a half hours (or just three, according to Stake themselves) to publish an acknowledgment, despite managing to put out a tone-deaf promo tweet in the meantime.\nHowever, the announcement fails to mention the transactions on Polygon, or address reports that user withdrawals are currently suspended.\nAfter another four hours, the team tweeted again, informing users that deposits and withdrawals had resumed.\nSurely $41M must be a drop in the ocean for Stake, with co-founder Bijan Tehrani earlier stating that there would be no impact on customer funds.\nSo why the delay, and the omissions, in official comms?\n\nCredit: tayvano, PeckShield\nGiven that the transactions, which began at 12:48 UTC, were simple transfers, it appears that the private keys of Stake's hot wallets had been compromised.\nThe funds were drained as native tokens (6k ETH, 3M MATIC and 12k BNB, totalling $14M), a total of $22.3M in stablecoins, plus $650k of SHIB and $3.25M of Binance-pegged ETH.\nStake’s hot wallet addresses (on Ethereum, Polygon and BSC) are showing no transfers since approximately 3 hours after the draining, suggesting that users are indeed currently unable to withdraw.\nFunds were drained into the following hacker addresses:\nETH: 0x3130662aece32f05753d00a7b95c0444150bcd3c\nMATIC: 0xfe3f568d58919b14aff72bd3f14e6f55bec6c4e0\nBSC: 0x4464e91002c63a623a8a218bd5dd1f041b61ec04\nAny non-native assets were then swapped to native tokens and distributed to other addresses, see the full list here, and mainnet fund-flow diagram here.\n\nBacked by Drake, and relentlessly shilled by Bitboy, Stake has grown by appealing to a largely normie audience.\nAnd for washing scammers’ loot, of course… just like a real casino.\nRollbit may have been making more noise recently thanks to its pumping token, but Stake is clearly doing just fine, making enough to buy a $28M mansion last year.\nAussie crypto founders certainly know how to cash out.\nBut with Stake’s main fanboy Bitboy out of the picture so recently, the timing certainly seems coincidental.\nThen again, anyone trading shitcoins via Metamask is probably not the type to pull off a multimillion dollar hack...\nStake may be a casino but, ultimately, this story is the same as a large number of CEX hacks we've covered over the last few years.\nDeFi might have a reputation for incidents of this size, and looking at the leaderboard it'd be hard to argue that it was undeserved.\nBut centralised platforms should be held to a higher standard.\nDeFi protocols are open books, where permissions, privileges, and source code are published so users can DYOR.\nWhere are CeFi's disclosures of who has access to private keys within their systems? Some may argue that this would pose a risk of individuals being targeted for phishing campaigns (or worse).\nSo should they overhaul their entire infrastructure?\nTens of millions held in hot wallets behind a single set of private keys...\nHow many more ‘coincidences’ can we take?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The increasingly intertwined nature of DeFi protocols, combined with the complexity of the attack, left the community confused as to who the real victim was, and who was responsible for making reparations.\nThe attackers' contract made the Homora code “believe” that their malicious contract was one of their own in order to manipulate internal debt numbers in their system.\nThis was a private battle between protocol and attacker. The exploited contract was not yet announced, nor was it available to users, meaning they were not directly affected. We have not yet seen such a blatant inside job, and Alpha Finance were quick to point out that they had a “prime suspect”.\nWhy was the contract left on mainnet if it was not yet ready? We asked Alpha Finance, who told us;\n\"We launched several pools e.g. sUSD on the contract level and not the UI because we were preparing to launch new pools including sUSD that coming week\"\nLarge players quickly moved to preserve their capital amidst the confusion. SBF withdrew $400 million of FTT from Cream Finance, and Three Arrows Capital sent over $3 million of $ALPHA to Binance, where the only purpose could be to sell.\nAll tokens related to the attack decreased in value.\nThe Alpha Homora governance token ALPHA fell from $2.25 to $1.78.\nThe Iron Bank governance token CREAM fell from $288.32 to $193.51.\nAAVE, the governance from the home of the controversial flash loan which has enabled so many attacks of this nature, fell from $518 to a low of $492 later in the day.\nHowever, token pricing is not the most interesting aspect of this story...\n\nThe Alpha Finance team built an excellent post-mortem, and what they found was startling. The implications of our joint investigation suggest a depth of corruption much worse than expected.\nWhether Alpha Finance goes public with their accusations remains to be seen, but their initial statement of having a prime suspect suggests that repercussions are coming.\nFrom the official post-mortem, we can see that the attacker needed to know the following in order to carry out the attack:\nWith so many users watching on, the robbers left a clear trail of clues, and in a rare move of counter-aggression, the victims have singled out their attacker.\nThe above requirements prove that insider information was required in order to carry out this attack. However, due to the range of protocols and audit firms involved, the insider could have come from several different angles.\nrekt is no longer in the business of making accusations, but we look forward to seeing how Alpha Finance handle the situation.\nHow it happened according to Alpha Finance:\n1. The attacker created an evil spell (equivalent to Yearn’s strategy). https://etherscan.io/tx/0x2b419173c1f116e94e43afed15a46e3b3a109e118aba166fcca0ba583f686d23\n2.

One including an exact debt calculation. This took teams of researchers hours to figure out. Alpha took immediate steps to mitigate the exploit. It was addressed within minutes of original discovery.\nAnd Banteg’s reply:\nThe setup is absolutely insane. No way this could be found by someone casually looking at the contracts, especially the unannounced stuff.\nPerhaps this will lead to another Yearn acquisition; Cronje’s name is mentioned 4 times in the post-mortem, and the pattern does seem familiar...\n\nHow much longer can this era last for the anonymous hackers?\nAs the list of possible suspects is so small, it becomes easier to rule out and track down potential attackers, in this case the list is even smaller than usual.\n“Don’t trust, verify” is an excellent mantra when working with code, yet it does not prevent the increasing social paranoia that must be growing in the upper circles of decentralised finance.\nWe’re living through a period of unprecedented growth for cryptocurrency and DeFi, where the cost of not working is incredibly high. The mental load for DeFi developers grows heavier day by day.\nEmpires are being built upon lines of code, and the future of finance is being constructed before our eyes.\nDevelopers are locked in a race to the sky while corrupt insiders help hackers to work underground, picking holes in their foundations.\nWhen one tower falls, the others look on and learn. Before the dust has even settled, the crowds have moved on, and relentless teams return to the race in a quest to build back stronger.\nHow long can they maintain this intensity before the inevitable mistake causes their cloak of anonymity to fall?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

An initial, direct hack in August led to a breach of a third-party cloud storage provider, in November.\nWhile the original August statement reassured users:\nwe have seen no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data or encrypted password vaults\nThe December update revealed that:\nThe threat actor was also able to copy a backup of customer vault data\nAnd contained an onminous warning:\nThe threat actor may attempt to use brute force to guess your master password and decrypt the copies of vault data they took.\nHowever, victims apparently had very secure LastPass master passwords which, according to Tayvano, either means that:\nsomeone has compromised hundreds of users' vaults one-by-one via a still undetected method or…\nLastPass has still not shared some critical details about their security posture and the stuff that was compromised by the attackers.\nAlthough the known thefts date back as far as mid-December 2022, with the tracing operation well underway by April, the LastPass connnection was only made public in August.\nThe attackers appear not to be interested in small fry, with the smallest loss being “well over $10k”.\nVictims, one of whom even lost funds which had been untouched for almost a decade, apparently include many experienced crypto users:\nemployees of reputable crypto orgs, VCs, people who build defi protocols, deploy contracts, run full nodes, and have ENS names\nAside from targeting LastPass users, the attacks appear to share certain characteristics, which include:\nPrimary theft txns are almost always between 10am–4pm UTC.\nExcept when stealing v large amounts, the attacker will swap your tokens for ETH inside your wallet before sending the ETH out.\nThe attacker will often miss staked positions, NFTs, or lesser known tokens. Successful rescue missions are COMMON.\nFunds are eventually sent to a CEX such as “FixedFloat, SimpleSwap, SideShift, ChangeNOW, LetsExchange”.\nThe hackers also seem to favour the weekends.\nOver $37M stolen and still working a day job?\n\nWhile initial comms from LastPass in August 2022 made it seem that there was no reason to worry, any user who then let their guard down may later have become a victim.\nThough there may be good reason to be guarded with info sharing, the safest option for users is always to rotate assets to a fresh seed phrase if in any doubt.\nImproved UX is not worth trusting sensitive info to 3rd parties.\nWhen did you last change your seed?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Via trading between these newly created pairs, the attacker was able to manipulate the prices that Vee Finance referenced.\nThis manipulation, together with the fact that price acquisition wasn’t processed for decimals, allowed for the approval of transactions that would usually not pass the protocol’s slippage check.\nFor an in-depth analysis of the exploit, see Vee Finance’s second post-mortem of the day.\nThe stolen funds were bridged back to Ethereum during and after the attack, over a series of over 100 transactions, for example this transaction.\nThe exploiter’s Ethereum wallet currently holds a total of 214 WBTC ($9.3 M) and 8,804 WETH ($26.9M)\n\nAccording to Vee Finance’s incident report “The VEE team is actively working to further clarify the incident and will continue to try to contact the attacker to recover the assets” and are appealing to the hacker to take a bug bounty.\nThe team sent a transaction to the exploiter’s addresses on both Ethereum and Avalanche, with the following message, also sharing on Twitter:\nHello, this is vee.finance team. We are willing to launch a bug bounty program for the bug you identified, please contact us via contact@vee.finance.\nOther incoming transactions contained messages, too, ranging from warnings:\nYour address has been caught by the team\nTo self-promo:\nHello this is @yannickcrypto, please follow me on twitter https://twitter.com/yannickcrypto_\nTo outright begging on-chain:\nBig man, send me some for a poor man who can't afford to eat\nAt press time, there was still no response from Big man.\n\nVee Finance ignored the recommendations given in their Slowmist audit, and their Certik audit wasn’t much help either.\nAny project which appears in “pump groups” such as this one is not doing well at all.\nWill we see a vee-shaped recovery, or has all the value veritably vanished?\n(Please consider the task of your anonymous author when naming your protocols)\n\nIf you enjoy our work, please donate to our Gitcoin Grant.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

As early as December, ZachXBT had been sounding alarms about the project's founder and team, calling them out as bad actors who avoided paying what they owed in several instances:\nFailing to pay money owed to Pancakesbrah.\nNot announcing winners for their $200K giveaway after 2 months.\nAvoiding paying CL207 for a bet.\nUsing a gore video from a recent murder to market their casino.\nNot reimbursing people after their team member was phished.\nThe allegations painted a picture of a team with little regard for integrity or accountability long before the rug pull.\nThe Series A investors had terms of 15% TGE, 3 month cliff, and 15 month linear vesting, the same vesting schedule that was ultimately imposed on user funds without disclosure.\nZKasino had also initially planned IDOs on ApeTerninal and AIT Protocol that were abruptly canceled without explanation, another red flag.\nIn their Telegram investor chat, team member XBT_Prometheus repeatedly downplayed concerns, stating \"We're still building\", \"People always FUD, it's normal\", and \"We didn't scam anything\" as questions mounted.\nZKasino CEO promised users a clean payout if they locked their ETH to farm the $ZKAS token, vowing to let them withdraw initially deposited ETH at a 1:1 ratio later on.\nBut in a brazen rug move, the platform instead converted over 10,500 ETH worth $33 million into $ZKAS at an inflated price without consent.\nTo compound the scheme, that staggering ETH pile was then staked on Lido to lock up the funds with a 15 month vesting schedule that was never mentioned.\nThe site’s bridge webpage (now offline) previously stated that once the chain was live, funds would be ‘returned and can be bridged back.’ Deleted tweets and audio clips confirm the same.\nIn the end, ZKasino's trail of red flags, deception, and unethical practices was glaringly obvious to anyone who cared to look.\nThis rug eventually unraveled into one of the biggest and most obvious crypto exit scams of the year.\nFor Satoshi’s Sake, if ZachXBT is calling something a scam months in advance, run and do not walk to the exits!\nWho likes to gamble at a casino where only the house wins?\n\nThe shady history of the founder should have raised concerns about his ability to lead a legitimate project like ZKasino successfully.\nHowever, investors and users seemingly overlooked or ignored these warning signs about the founder's past.\nFurthermore, there were allegations of unpaid employees and contractors, as well as claims of mismanagement from sources like ZachXBT.\nThese reports hinted at potential issues within the ZKasino team and operations, which should have prompted further scrutiny and due diligence from those considering investing or participating in the platform.\nZKasino made inflated claims about using advanced technologies like zkSync, when in reality, the platform was simply running on the more basic Arbitrum network.\nThis brazen discrepancy between their marketing and reality should have erased any last shreds of credibility.\nThe Captain Obvious of red flags was the abrupt cancellation of ZKasino's token listings without clear explanations provided.\nSuch last-minute changes, especially without transparency, should have been seen as potential signs of trouble brewing behind the scenes.\nBut sometimes when people step into the casino, they may already know in the back of their mind that they could lose it all.\nZKasino sure was a losing bet, wasn’t it?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Now their copied codes have built up enough capital, and they have entered the rug pull phase.\nThe aftermath presents an interesting situation.\nWill CZ and team roll back their corporate chain, or allow their users to suffer the loss?\nThis suricate scam leaves the thieves with nowhere to hide.\nWhere can they run to on such a small chain? Binance has closed the bridges, and even bscscan.com went down for a short while. Was this too much traffic, or some type of smokescreen?\nMeerkat Finance first claimed it was a hack but then deleted their accounts, leaving BSC users with only themselves, or maybe Binance to blame.\n\nWith thanks to 0xdeadf4ce.\nUsually, if the contract has a function which allows the owner to retrieve the assets which are used in the strategy/vault actively, then you are placing your trust in the project team.\nThey can pull the plug any time.\nThat’s why projects like yearn add checks like in the image below, so that the team can only rescue the funds which are not in active use by the strategy/vault.\n\nBoth affected Vaults used OpenZeppelin’s Transparent Proxy Upgrade pattern, allowing to upgrade the Vault logic to a new logic implementation by calling the function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) on the Vault proxy level.\nThe BUSD Vault’s previous implementation is located at 0x49509a31898452529a69a64156ab66167e755dfb, the WBNB Vault’s previous implementation is located at 0x3586a7d9904e9f350bb7828dff05bf46a18bb271, both being rather inconspicuous and verified contracts.\nMeerkat Finance Deployer calls upgradeTo() two times:\nThis changed the Vault logic to introduce two noteworthy functions that have not been part of the initial implementations.\nThere’s no permission check, making this newly added function the ultimate backdoor into the Vaults.\nUsing a specific Initializer pattern in transparent proxies is best-practice and was also applied in the first Vault implementations, so it is highly questionable what was the intend to add the init() method other than a planned theft of Vault funds.\nSource code is not available, decompiled source is limited to checking that the caller is equal to storage slot 0 set in init() method and transferring out the balanceOf() on the token contract supplied with param1, using the Vault address as the query target.\nBoth functions are not part of the previous Vault implementations.\nComparing the bytecode size of old and new implementations it can be stated that the new implementation is only 1/4th the size of the previous logic.\nSince the upgrades were done by the Meerkat Finance Deployer the most likely scenario given all aspects of the on-chain data is an intentional “rug pull” while granted there is a small chance of private key compromisation.\nAs of the time of writing funds have partially been split among various addresses and sent to what seemingly belongs to the Binance Bridge hosted by Binance exchange.\nThe Binance.org Bridge is currently suspended, probably to avoid the funds from being easily moved to other chains.\nTimeline (04.03.2021)\nMar-04-2021 08:53:10 AM +UTC\nMeerkat Finance Deployer upgrades WBNB Vault to contract 0x9d3a4c3acee56dce2392fb75dd274a249aee7d57\nMar-04-2021 08:53:31 AM +UTC\nMeerkat Finance Deployer upgrades BUSD Vault to contract 0xb2603fc47331e3500eaf053bd7a971b57e613d36\nMar-04-2021 08:54:31 AM +UTC\nAttacker calls method 0x70fcb0a7 on BUSD Vault to transfer out 13,968,039 BUSD\nMar-04-2021 08:54:55 AM +UTC\nAttacker calls method 0x70fcb0a7 on WBNB Vault to transfer out 73,635 WBNB\n\nThe same games are played on different chains, but the balance of power is different. With CZ watching and the bridges burning, the robbers have nowhere to hide.\nEven in the Meerkat_Rugpull Telegram group, chat members were not in total agreement of how they wanted Binance to handle the situation.\n\nCould Binance roll back the chain and refund their users?\nThe answer is not so clear - the 21 mystery validators could in theory arrange a refund, but it is unlikely. It would only fuel the CeDeFi issues and create more work for the (likely already stressed) BSC lawyers.\nBinance will have planned in advance how they would handle such a scenario. How they handle this case will set a precedent.\nAlthough this is not the first multimillion rugpull on BSC, it is the first since the rise of PancakeSwap and the increased user numbers that came along with it.\nIgnoring the unlikely event of someone from Binance stepping up to arrange a merkle distributor and returning the funds, the money is gone.\nSo we find that protocols on BSC are no more secure than Ethereum.\nCZ won’t save you. Their transactions are cheaper, but there’s no original development.\nWhat will become of this corporate chain once Eth L2 arrives?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Rather than the standard pool model of paired assets deposited by LPs, MonoX pools function by grouping a deposited token “into a virtual pair with our virtual cash stablecoin (vCASH)”.\nOne of the benefits that MonoX claimed their virtual pool model brought was streamlined swap routing.\nHow convenient for today’s hacker who, manipulating a pricing bug, was able to inflate the price of the platform's native token and make a streamlined cash-out into the other deposited tokens.\nTwo attacks hit the protocol in swift succession.\nFirst, ~$19.4M was stolen on Polygon and just 17 minutes later, the same attack vector was used on Ethereum, taking a further ~$12M.\nThe team provided a statement via the MonoX Announcements channel on Telegram, and later via Twitter.\n...A method in the swap contract was exploited and boosted MONO token price to sky high. The attacker then used $MONO to purchase all the other assets in the pool...\n...We also really wish to have a chance in talking with the \"attacker\". We value very much for what we've built for the current and future MonoX, and most importantly our users and their funds; PLEASE reach out to us!\n\nCredit: @BlockSecTeam\nThe protocol’s recently-launched MONO token was used in the exploit. The hacker was able to massively inflate its value owing to a bug in the swapTokenForExactToken code in the Monoswap contract (Polygon, Ethereum).\n\nThe function _updateTokenInfo was used to update token prices following swaps through MonoX pools. However, there was nothing to restrict the use of the same asset for both tokenIn and tokenOut.\nBy doing just this with the platform’s native token, the hacker created a loop in which the price of tokenOut would overwrite the price of tokenIn, pumping the price of MONO over the course of many “swaps”.\nOnce the price had been manipulated, the attacker cashed out the overvalued MONO for almost all the other tokens deposited in the platform’s Single Token Liquidity pools.\nBoth Halborn and Peckshield conducted audits of the Monoswap contract. How did they both miss this simple bug? Was it deliberate, or just careless?\nTotal assets stolen:\n5.7M MATIC ($10.5M)\n3.9k WETH ($18.2M)\n36.1 WBTC ($2M)\n1.2k LINK ($31k)\n3.1k GHST ($9.1k)\n5.1M DUCK ($257k)\n4.1k MIM ($4.1k)\n274 IMX ($2k)\nExploit transactions: Polygon, Ethereum.\nExploit contracts: Polygon, Ethereum\nStolen funds: ($31.4M total) Polygon ($19.4M), Ethereum ($12M).\n\nOver $30M lost on a protocol barely one month old. In fact, the project had passed $30M TVL just 3 days prior to the exploit.\nWhile the rate at which projects are now able to attract value is impressive, the insecurity that comes with investing in DeFi is a stark reminder of the immaturity of the space.\nWith time, casualties like these build a base of knowledge on which best practises can be established.\nBut for now, experiments will continue to be launched.\nAnd some of them will fail.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The assessment was also that it was a high risk retrieval that could only be attempted once and required Safe to support. Retrieval was scheduled for 7th of June. However, the assumption that the funds can only be recoverable by Wintermute proved to be false.\nAs Wintermute’s Gnosis Safe on mainnet had been created back in 2020, it was deployed using an old version of the ProxyFactory contract, which includes the out-of-date create opcode, rather than create2.\nWith create, the deployed proxy address depends only on the ProxyFactory’s address and nonce. This meant that the exploiter could replay deployments on Optimism (setting themself as owner) until the nonce matched the original mainnet deployment and a matching proxy address was created.\nThis was eventually achieved after running batched deployments of 162 safes at a time, until the matching address was created in this transaction.\nExploiter’s address, used to create the adapted ProxyFactory contract, which was funded by Tornado Cash on the 1st June.\nWintermute’s multisig on Ethereum: 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81\nHijacked address on Optimism: 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81\nSo far, 1M OP has been sent to the exploiter’s EOA and sold for 720 ETH, and a further 1M OP was sent to Vitalik’s address.\n\nThe exploiter’s timing is interesting, as pointed out by yoav.eth:\nFunded via Tornado 7 days ago\nThen deployed the contract, waited 4 days, and hijacked wintermute's proxy.\nWhy wait 4 days?\nIf they were looking to secure their loot, why give Wintermute the extra time to mount a rescue attempt?\nThe remaining 18M OP have not yet been dumped, is this down to a lack of liquidity or does the exploiter intend to return the funds?\nWintermute aren’t banking on it:\nThere is hope that it is a whitehat exploit, in which case the remaining funds are potentially recoverable. However we are currently operating under the premise that it is not the case\nIn the meantime, the Optimism Foundation has provided an additional 20M OP to Wintermute to perform their original market making duties.\nWintermute’s balance sheet aside, there are more wide-reaching concerns raised by this incident.\nHaving almost 10% of the OP circulating supply in the hands of a bad actor is potentially dangerous for Optimism’s governance processes, something the Foundation is well aware of.\nShould this change, the option of “a network upgrade … to halt the movement of those OP tokens” would set a worrying precedent.\nAlthough the mistake was flagged on OP’s launch day, the alert was seemingly ignored by the community. The tweet came hours after the exploiter had funded their address, however, so is unlikely to have been the information to tip-off the incident.\nWhile replacing the 20M OP won’t be a problem for a giant MM such as Wintermute, the carelessness of this incident is alarming.\nThe funds were sat in an unowned address for 9 days.\nIn an already struggling market, actions such as these make it hard to remain Optimistic.\n\nIf you enjoy our work, please consider donating to our Gitcoin Grant.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

A textbook double-dip, inflating the attacker's staking balance and siphoning off undeserved rewards.\n\nExploit transaction: 0x56e09abb35ff12271fdb38ff8a23e4d4a7396844426a94c4d3af2e8b7a0a2813\nExploiter Addresses:\n0x7a2f4d625fb21f5e51562ce8dc2e722e12a61d1b0xc0Eb7e6E2b94aA43BDD0c60E645fe915d5c6eb84\nFake Pendle Market:0x0ab305033592E16dB7D8e77d613F8d172a76ddc9\nAttack contracts:\nArbitrum: 0x4BC9815b859c8172CEe1ab2CD372fD0Eb00eb487\nEthereum: 0x4aF4C234B8CB6e060797e87AFB724cfb1d320Bb7\nDespite audits by WatchPug and Zokyo, this glaring oversight slipped through the cracks.\nPenpie has posted a message to the hacker on Twitter, hoping to retrieve the stolen loot.\nPendle posted a Post Mortem on behalf of Penpie on Twitter, where they mentioned the $105 million that wasn’t stolen, but failed to mention what was stolen and the specifics behind the exploit.\nYet another reminder that even in the world of trustless systems, we're still putting an awful lot of faith in protocols to do their security due diligence.\nThe exploiter, armed with nothing more than some clever code and a dash of audacity, managed to outsmart multiple layers of supposed security.\nIn this game of digital cat and mouse, are we building fortresses or just more elaborate mazes?\n\nPenpie's misfortune serves as a stark reminder that in the wild west of DeFi, even the sharpest tools can get dulled.\nIt's a tale as old as time (or at least as old as smart contracts), in the rush to innovate, security sometimes takes a back seat.\nAs the DeFi space continues to evolve at breakneck speed, it's clear that even more rigorous security measures and audit processes are needed.\nBut in a world where \"move fast and break things\" is the modus operandi, can we really expect protocols to pump the brakes?\nIs it too much to ask protocols that hold millions in users funds to audit every upgrade?\nIn this case, it appears so.\nFor now, Penpie joins the ever-growing list of protocols that have fallen victim to exploits in the digital Wild West.\nIs it time for DeFi protocols to prioritize security over speed, thoroughly auditing upgrades and fortifying defenses, or will they continue to gamble with user funds and leave themselves vulnerable to relentless blackhat gunslingers?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

However, the information we received correlates with some of our previously held suspicions.\nTechrate audits are not to be trusted.\n\nThe rug pull started with this transaction:\n\nAn initial $22.2 million in stablecoins were taken from the StableMagnet 3Pool via an unverified source code.\nThis figure is now $27M and rising.\nAs stated by Rugdoc:\nEtherscan and BSCScan explorers do not verify linked library source code.\nThis allows the exploiter to deploy a completely different library than the one in the source code.\nThe unverified SwapUtil library did not only contain code to drain all pairs, it also contained code to transfer more tokens to everyone who had approved StableMagnet.\nSwapUtils library containing the exploit:0xE25d05777BB4bD0FD0Ca1297C434e612803eaA9a\nOther protocols which are still in operation, such as Dopple and StableGaj are based upon the same code, and their SwapUtils libraries are also unverfied.\n\nThe stolen funds were split between multiple addresses and deposited to Binance in order to switch to the Ethereum blockchain, then quickly withdrawn and the centralised USDT exchanged for decentralised DAI.\nThese attackers had planned their escape route.\nIs the Binance KYC process faulty, or do Binance care less about enforcing the law than they would have us believe?\nBUSD sent to Binance hot wallet: 0x2bac04457e5de654cf1600b803e714c2c3fb96d7\nTether received on ETH chain: 0xDF5B180c0734fC448BE30B7FF2c5bFc262bDEF26\nTether changed to DAI: 0xe5daac909a3205f99d370bc2b32b1810a4912a07\nThis pattern has been replicated across multiple addresses.\nCould this be the rug that keeps on rugging?\nAt one point, there were over 1000 users with non-zero allowances on the rugpulled StableMagnet.\nWith an initial entry at number 8, this case is set to keep on climbing the rekt leaderboard as we uncover more of the story and the wallets of unsuspecting users continue to be drained.\nThis is not the first time that this group has rugpulled, but this time they’ve left us some clues.\n\nThe other information that was given to us by our anonymous source is given more authenticity following the events at StableMagnet.\nThey told us that the same group is responsible for multiple recent rugpulls, suggesting that Moon Here token, and Wen Moon token were also carried out by the same bad actors.\nThey also told us that “Techrate audited the Github, but not the deployed contract”\nWe know that Techrate was alerted to this rugpull, and that they took no action.  A quick glance through the list of projects that they are involved with will give you a good idea of the kind of quality you can expect with a Techrate audited project.\nWhy should we expect them to point out the problem, rather than let it slide and come back to it later when they are wearing their black hat?\nIn a space and time where trust is already at a minimum, you would hope you could look to audit companies for some security.\nHowever, this is not the first incident in which the auditor becomes the number one suspect.\nWe know of at least two major hacks in which the protocol is working to prove that they were attacked by their auditor. Investigations are ongoing.\nThis has been one of the more sinister rug pulls that we have documented. A known group of attackers stealing not only from their scam protocol, but also directly from users wallets, then fleeing to the decentralised protection of DAI.\nDon’t trust an auditor to DYOR.\n\nIf you enjoy our work, please donate to our Gitcoin grant.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Calamities: Southeast Asian Edition.\"\nOn September 10th, Indodax, Indonesia's largest crypto exchange, learned a costly lesson in the dangers of wallet management and the persistence of sophisticated hacking groups.\nAs alerts of the exploit spread, observers watched in fascination as the hackers performed their dark magic, siphoning funds across multiple chains with the finesse of a digital David Copperfield.\nIn the world of centralized exchanges, \"not your keys, not your crypto\" isn't just a catchy slogan, it's a warning that keeps ringing true.\nIn the wake of this Indonesian crypto tsunami, will Indodax's reputation be as leaky as its security protocols?\n\nCredit: Cyvers, Lookonchain, SlowMist, William Sutanto, Arkham Intel, Bein Crypto\nThe first signs of trouble came when Cyvers raised the alarm on Twitter: \"Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions involving your wallets on different networks.\"\nIt didn't take long for the blockchain sleuths to mobilize.\nWithin hours, a clearer picture emerged of the devastation:\n6.14M USDT\n1,047 ETH ($2.48M)\n25 BTC ($1.41M)\n2.2M MATIC ($849K)\n1.4M ARB ($749.6K)\n2M ENA ($465K)\n...and the list goes on totaling roughly $25.22 million.\nAs the crypto sleuths pieced together the digital breadcrumbs, a familiar pattern began to emerge.\nYosi Hammer, Head of AI at Cyvers, provided some intriguing insights:\n\"While it is premature to confirm the involvement of any specific group, the attack's speed and complexity, the pattern and the characteristics of the attack highly resembles those of North Korea's Lazarus Group.\"\nHammer, however, emphasized that it’s too early to confirm the attackers’ identity.\nSlowMist's analysis ruled out a simple hot wallet compromise, suggesting a more insidious breach of the withdrawal system itself.\nIn a move that would make Ocean's Eleven blush, the hackers managed to initiate withdrawals that looked legitimate, complete with change addresses depositing back into Indodax.\nCompromised Indodax hot wallets:\nEth/Polygon: 0x3C02290922a3618A4646E3BbCa65853eA45FE7C6  \nTron: TWe5pEnPDetzxgJS4uN26VFg15wWtdcTXc\nBTC: 1JUToCyRL5UwgeucjnFAagKs4v1YqhjT1d  \nAs onlookers held their collective breath, Indodax finally broke their silence, announcing a \"complete maintenance\" to ensure system integrity.\nIn a move that surely instilled confidence, Indodax co-founder William Sutanto assured users that their funds were \"100% safe both in crypto and rupiah.\"\nBecause nothing says \"everything's fine\" like completely shutting down your platform.\nThe hackers, meanwhile, weren't content with their initial haul.\nLike kids in a crypto candy store, they proceeded to swap their ill-gotten gain and moved their stolen loot here:\nEthereum ($12.37m):\n0x59101E532bc728599a2d373fCdC7aFf58cB48Df8\nMisc erc-20 tokens on Ethereum ($1.2m): 0xB0A2e43D3E0dc4C71346A71484aC6a2627bbCbeD\nOptimism

($1.4m):\nbc1q5uqpn0ha5llrvhcvkq3nfalp8fj7qe3rydcvmf\nIn this game of cat and mouse, it seems the attackers have once again proven they're the Garfield of the crypto world- fat, sassy, and always getting the lasagna.\nWith Cyvers reporting over 150 transactions in this digital heist, untangling this crypto yarn promises to be more complex than decoding a teenager's TikTok feed.\nOne thing's for sure: when the post-mortem drops, it'll be a page-turner that'd make even the most hardened crypto-detective's head spin.\nGrab your popcorn, folks, this blockchain whodunit is far from over.\nThe stolen stash was a relatively small amount as the exchange’s wallets continue to hold over $400 million worth of various tokens, as Arkham data shows.\nBack in June 2023, Indonesian cops nabbed a duo of digital doppelgangers who were masquerading as Indodax on social media.\nThese crafty con artists were peddling fool's gold to unsuspecting marks, managing to pilfer a cool 625 million Indonesian Rupiah (about $40,500) before the law caught up with them.\nIndodax's misfortune serves as a stark reminder that in the wild east of crypto exchanges, even the biggest fish can get caught in a net.\nWhen exchanges are playing whack-a-mole with threats ranging from two-bit hustlers to sophisticated hackers wielding nation-state level techniques, is \"not your keys, not your crypto\" less of a mantra and more of a survival guide?\n\nIt's a tale as old as Bitcoin, in the rush to provide liquidity, security sometimes takes a back seat.\nAs the crypto space continues to grapple with the reality of highly sophisticated hacking groups, it's clear that even more rigorous security measures are needed.\nBut in a world where exchanges are locked in an arms race with some of the most skilled hackers on the planet, can we really expect them to keep up?\nIs it too much to ask exchanges that hold millions in user funds to better secure their hot wallets, implement stricter withdrawal controls, and maybe hire a security guard named Brutus?\nIn this case, it appears so.\nFor now, Indodax joins the ever-growing list of exchanges that have fallen victim to high-profile digital heists.\nAs hackers continue to target crypto exchanges with increasing sophistication, one has to wonder: Is your favorite exchange next on their hit list or have they already paid their \"security debt\"?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20):

(without any prior testing)\nConvert to renBTC and exit to BTC / ETH via Tornado Cash\nThe attacker was able to withdraw more USDT at step 4 because of the changed USDT price. As the price of USDT was lower during the time of the withdrawal, their shares represent more USDT from the Vault pool.\nApproximately 4 cycles can fit into a 10m gas limit, and although the profit on each cycle is less than 1%, ~$500k per repetition adds up quickly.\nThe price calculation mechanism for LP deposits and withdrawals was the source of the exploit, meaning this attack could have carried over to the renBTC pool, the FARM_TUSD pool, and the FARM_DAI pool. However the hacker chose to stop after draining $25m or 17% of what was available in the FARM_USDT and FARM_USDC pools, although they could have easily continued to drain the entire pool for a total of $400m if they had so desired.\nThe FARM_USDT strategy has the following code\n\nWhich indicates some price index was calculated.\nHowever, since they specify \"tokenIndex\", we can assume they aren't just using get_virtual_price() but instead, do some underlying calculation.\nCredit Andre Cronje\n\nThe arbitrage check function tolerance value was not high enough, but the default slippage tolerance value of 3% was too high.\nCredit PancakeBunnyFin\nIt wasn’t just the hacker who profited from their actions.

While your author was writing this story, someone contacted us with information regarding the actions of Harvest Finance some days prior to last nights events.\nThe following information is presented without comment.\nI was contacted by the Harvest Finance team seeking collaboration on incentivising liquidity pools for two asset classes.\nThe first was trustless BTC, the second was FARM/ETH.\n\nI didn’t follow up with them as something was off-putting.\nI’m not claiming that it is the Harvest team, but seeing the 3% slippage in the smart contract, and the fact that the exploit was in trustless BTC, which is a “novelty”...\nI think that if this isn’t Julien, then it has to be Harvest Finance themselves, or the EMN hacker, or someone with deep flashloan knowledge.\nRefund Requests\nAs usual, a debate has arisen regarding the ability for protocols to block or amend this type of activity in the future. In the Curve Telegram group, some were of the opinion that Curve should be able to block this type of activity, however the existing smart contracts cannot be stopped or modified.\nThere have also been calls for renBTC to refund the fees they earned from the hackers activity. This is a controversial topic which forces users to consider the pros and cons of using decentralised protocols.\nSloppy Security\nOnly three weeks ago on October 6th, Harvest Finance published a security update stating that they were ensuring the safety of their lands via “rigorous security audits” from Peckshield, Haechi Labs, and CertiK.\nIt should be noted that Peck Shield and CertiK also audited Bzx before their three hacks earlier this year.\nWe await their comments on this situation.\nDevelopers and seemingly even specialised security firms are not used to having to consider the impact of flash loans on their code.\nMastering flash loans is like turning up to a 12th century jousting tournament on a Harley Davidson dual-wielding AK47’s; nobody expects it, plebs get rekt, and it’s years until the uneducated masses are able to protect themselves from such savage master tradesmen.\nHarvest Finance has responded to the events with an enjoyably passive-aggressive tone.\n\ntwitter.com/harvest_finance/status/1320624369543057409\n\nTruthful Terminology\nArbitrage / Exploit / Hack.\nThe differences in the terminology become increasingly blurred, while the fact that “code is law” becomes crystal clear.\nThe term used by Harvest Finance was arbitrage economic attack. Some consider this activity a crime, while others simply see the actions of a more capable user, yield farming with modern machinery.\nIs this a meritocracy, or anarcho-capitalism?\nIt’s certainly entertaining either way.\ncaveat emptor.\nIt is only the farmer who faithfully plants seeds in the spring, who reaps a Harvest in the autumn.  B.C.

The upgraded version included a new function (0x3b3a5522) which allowed the attacker to bypass caller verification and mint tokens freely, directly to their own address.\nExploiters address: 0xf3a465c9fa6663ff50794c698f600faa4b05c777\n(Compromised) Ankr deployer address: 0x2ffc59d32a524611bb891cab759112a51f9e33c0\nExample attack tx (minting aBNBc to exploiter’s wallet): 0xe367d05e…\nFunding exploiter wallet from compromised deployer: 0xeb617798…\nDespite the large amount of tokens minted, a lack of on-chain liquidity limited the exploiter’s profits to just $5M after draining PancakeSwap’s aBNB pools. Most of the proceeds were bridged to Ethereum, where the exploiter is in the process of laundering them through Tornado Cash.\n\nAs the word got out about the publicly callable infinite mint, copycats joined in, many of whom can be seen amongst the top holders of the now worthless aBNBc.\nSome did find a way to profit, however, with one account making 3x more than the initial exploiter, however the quick timing and recent funding of the address suggest that it could be the same actor.\nBy buying large amounts of depegged aBNB from PancakeSwap, this address took the token to stablecoin project Helio Money.\nBefore the oracle had updated to reflect the crashed price, the user borrowed 16M HAY against aBNBc collateral for a profit of $15.5M. Another user profited through the same method, earning approximately $3.5M.\nThe attacks have caused HAY to depeg ($0.62 at the time of writing), but the project has assured its users that they will be compensated.\n\nAudits by both Peckshield and Beosin called out the danger that the privileged accounts posed to Ankr’s smart contracts, and were marked as “Confirmed” and “Acknowledged”, respectively.\nHowever, Ankr did not take steps to fix these issues.\nNow they have paid the price, and Helios has caught even more collateral damage.\nCZ tweeted the following summary:\n”Possible hacks on Ankr and Hay. Initial analysis is developer private key was hacked, and the hacker updated the smart contract to a more malicious one. Binance paused withdrawals a few hrs ago. Also froze about $3m that hackers move to our CEX.”\nIs CZ trying to become crypto’s new main character?\nSomeone should remind him that role never ends well…\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

On-chain swaps are disabled, and IBC channels are closed.\nThe failed UST recovery plan crashed the price of LUNA to fractions of a cent, down from an ATH of almost $120, just over a month ago.\nHowever, the Chainlink oracle, used as a price feed by both protocols to value collateral, contained a minimum price (minAnswer) for LUNA hardcoded at $0.10.\nAs the price dropped below this, anyone was able to buy up large quantities of LUNA at market price and use it as collateral (valued at $0.10) to borrow funds from the platforms.\nVenus, with a TVL of ~$1B, was (luckily) able to suspend activity before being totally cleaned out. There is currently an active proposal to resume functionality, but with LUNA and UST positions suspended.\nAccording to the official statement:\nVenus Protocol also has a Risk Fund that will be utilised to remedy the shortfall that resulted from this event.\nBlizz Finance, however, was unable to react in time, due to their timelock, leaving the protocol wiped out. A glance at the project’s site shows all assets lent out, supposedly on worthless collateral.\n$8.3M of TVL gone in a flash.\n\nWith both protocols claiming that the blame lies with Chainlink for the “pausing” of their price feeds, Chainlink put out a statement explaining the functionality of the automatic circuit breaker and describing best practices followed by other protocols.\n\nNo protocol is too big to fail.\nLUNA dropping below $0.10 may have been unthinkable when the Chainlink feed was set up, but as it became clear that LUNA was not going to recover, Chainlink should have updated their oracle’s parameters to reflect reality.\nThis incident shows that even using a reputable oracle such as Chainlink is not a silver bullet. The responsibility lies with each project to understand every element of their protocol and integrate everything in a safe and secure way, no matter what the market does.\nProtocols should have measures in place for these unforeseen events, such as their own automated circuit-breakers to pause contracts under such conditions, as suggested in Chainlink’s docs.\nUnfortunately, these two casualties are unlikely to be the last incidents linked to the implosion of Terra.\nAfter maintaining radio silence since announcing the plan to nuke LUNA, Do Kwon has just published his thoughts on how the chain should be resurrected.\nThe consequences continue, and we still don't know what happened to the $3B of BTC that belonged to the Luna Foundation…\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

So far, over 70% of the funds have been returned.\nFinding a vulnerability in an unverified contract; diligent decompiler, or someone acting on insider info?\n\nThough the vulnerability was in the project’s code, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users’ wallets to the unknown exploiter’s address.\nThe first attack tx occurred just after 18:30 UTC, with the attack lasting approximately half an hour before swapping stolen tokens to ETH and BNB.\nExploiter’s address on ETH and BSC: 0x75f2aba6a44580d7be2c4e42885d4a1917bffd46\nVulnerable contract (revoke approvals on both ETH and BSC): 0xed1afc8c4604958c2f38a3408fa63b32e737c428\nCredit: Supremacy Inc., SlowMist\nThe project’s smart contracts are unverified. However, they can be decompiled from the published bytecode:\nAfter understanding the hacker's attack path, we tried to find out the cause of the vulnerability, but the smart contracts of the project are closed-source contracts. So we decompiled it and finally found the root cause of this attack: a controllable transferFrom external call\n\nBecause it is decompiled code, it is a little obscure for readers to understand. We can understand that varg0 is the token address, varg1, varg2 and varg3 are the from, to and amount parameters of the transferFrom function.\n0x23b872dd in the figure is transferFrom() function signature of the function. Therefore, the claimTokens function calls the transferFrom function of an address, and the address and function parameters are controllable.\nFor a more detailed explanation, see SlowMist’s analysis.\nPeckshield also provided a visual summary of the attacker’s activities.\nThe returned funds have been consolidated into the same address (0xD989f7B4320c6e69ceA3d914444c19AB67D3a35E) on ETH and BSC, which holds a total of ~$16.5M across the two chains.\nStolen funds:\nAt the time of writing, the exploiter’s BSC address still holds over $3.5M in stolen BNB and previously sent 2500 BNB ($715k) to Tornado Cash.\n\nThe fast response and cooperation between multiple security teams meant this incident had a happier ending than most.\nBut a protocol using live, unverified contracts is never a good look in DeFi, where open-source is the name of the game.\nHiding contract code makes DYOR all but impossible, and impedes the work of whitehats to spot vulnerabilities before they’re exploited.\nClosed-source code also breeds suspicion in the blockchain world, where exploits, rug-pulls and “compromised keys” are often forgotten within weeks.\nCould this be a case of an insider using privileged info against their users, before returning most of the funds and hoping it will all blow over?\nBusiness as usual.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Unizen caught the spam situation shortly after.\nUnizen addressed the community 7 hours after the attack, offering to address concerns and start the healing process for their community.\nThe protocol’s CTO went into further detail, highlighting the gas optimization upgrade was a minor bug with great consequences.\n2 days after the hack, Unizen sent several onchain messages addressing a “Security Professional”, offering a 20% bounty to return the funds.\nOn-chain Messages:\n0x13f8220624f61cfb002489821eeba9df392150285147c1aaf816f283ae7cc43e\n0x351906b2406282042c7396ea960b7a52d305658097e3f25bae79be4cdbb7c311\n0x015b7fd22c027abb9c237a4ecb3862b7c3f2acb857fe93175e4a6c8265d38857\n0x0dc8ce3e98d006cd1ba446544b289d960477347e8826efa788d6b879a59cd09d\n0xcbdba5e11d3becfe80f8fd710d04fd068ad722289869459a7ce4f1e7123e5946\n0xdcfed8e883eec7f913c452b2ed0da29f3504722479400053482cddd7797f883f\n0xd5d684f3f61de25bd04b8434bb9af23658377350dee16ed2575d377426cebd89\nA few hours later, Unizen announced they will reimburse losses below $750,000 with USDC or USDT. CEO and Founder, Sean Noga loaned the protocol with his personal funds.\nThey even posted a video in the same announcement on how to revoke spend limit approvals on the Unizen platform. Where was this the day of the attack?\nLater in the day, the CTO announced  that they have enough evidence to proceed with the post-mortem.\nAdding that an upgrade was patched to the gas optimization contract. Claiming they will invest a lot more in ensuring the security with every upgrade introduced, no matter the risk assessments and internal reviews.\nBut one of the crooks may not be finished.\nCaught by Blockfence on March 11th, one of the attackers may have moved on to their next onchain sleight of hand.\nThey deposited 128 ETH of stolen loot in an LP on Uniswap, with the Yoink token.\nThey even left a message stating all profits from highly profitable trading strategies will be reinvested into Yoink. Did you mean to say hacking strategies?\nHalborn and Verichain audited Unizen's DEX Aggregator in 2022, no documentation can be found for an audit on the recent upgrade.\nDo you think this attack could have been prevented with an audit to their recent upgrade?\n\nAnother external call vulnerability and another attack on an upgradeable contract, when will this madness end?\nA costly mistake that could have been prevented with thorough testing and auditing.\nBlackhats have to be foaming at the mouth with a checklist of upcoming contract upgrades just waiting to pounce and run away with the loot.\nThe team's response may have been slow to keep their community updated, but it was refreshing how they handled the situation a few days later.\nUsers have already started to pour in to Unizen's Telegram  and on X, thanking them for  starting the reimbursement process, it appears they are following through so far.\nNot every hacked protocol reimburses users who get robbed. If the hack was a bigger hit, do you think they still would?\nEnsuring the security with every upgrade will surely be watched by blackhats waiting to pounce.\nWill Unizen continue to follow through and live up to their name?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

But did not announce it on X until a couple of hours after.\nSoon after the loss tallied up to $20 million in WETH, VELO, soVELO and Wrapped USDC.\nThe Optimism chain of Sonne Finance was exploited through a known donation attack on Compound v2 forks.\nAnother fork of Compound v2, Hundred Finance was rocked by a similar exploit roughly a year ago.\nHundred Finance sent out a warning to other Compound forks after their attack.\nIt appears that Sonne seemingly turned a deaf ear, because this was an attack that could have been prevented.\nWill these protocols ever learn?\n\nCredit: Nerv Alert, Luke Youngblood, Daniel Von Fange, Tony KΞ\nRinse, repeat, rekt - another DeFi protocol gets taken to the cleaners by a known exploit.\nA fork of Compound V2, Sonne held just over $60 million in TVL prior to the exploit.\nIn an infuriating display of ignoring history, Sonne became the latest Compound fork to succumb to an exploit that had already taken down protocols like Hundred Finance a year prior.\nLuke Youngblood provided an attack breakdown:\nThe Sonne Finance team deployed a new market contract for $VELO and a governance proposal was created to activate the market, which had a 4 day total governance period before going live.\n\nWhen the governance proposal succeeded 3 days later, and the 24 hour timelock expired, it was now executable by anyone on the Optimism network. The attacker made sure they were the one to execute it, probably by running a bot and hoping they were first to strike.\nThe attacker executed the proposal, along with their attack payload, all in a single transaction. The proposal set the collateral factor on the Sonne $VELO market to 35%, which enabled the attack to occur, and the protocol to immediately be drained of at least 7 figures of funds.\n\nAttacker:\n0xae4a7cde7c99fb98b0d5fa414aa40f0300531f43\nAttack Contract:0x02fa2625825917e9b1f8346a465de1bbc150c5b9\nTarget Contracts:soVELO: 0xe3b81318b1b6776f0877c3770afddff97b9f5fe5\nSoUSDC: 0xec8fea79026ffed168ccf5c627c7f486d77b765f\nsoWETH: 0xf7b5965f5c117eb1b5450187c9dcfccc3c317e8e\nAttack Transaction: 0x9312ae377d7ebdf3c7c3a86f80514878deb5df51aad38b6191d55db53e42b7f0\nStolen Funds currently held in several addresses:0x5d0d99e9886581ff8fcb01f35804317f5ed80bbb\n0x6277ab36a67cfb5535b02ee95c835a5eec554c07\n0xae4a7cde7c99fb98b0d5fa414aa40f0300531f43\n0x9f09ec563222fe52712dc413d0b7b66cb5c7c795\n0x3b39652151102d19ca41544a635956ef97416598\n0x9f44c4ec0b34c2dde2268ed3acbf3aba8eacde51\nDaniel Von Fange delved deeper into the critical errors committed by Sonne, and provided recommendations for protocols employing multisig wallets alongside timelock governance.\nThe TL;DR: if a series of actions must happen in a certain order in order to be safe, make sure your governance process doesn't allow picking and choosing what to execute, be atomic.\nSonne was quick to issue a Post-mortem on the exploit roughly 5 hours after the attack.\nThey highlighted how they previously avoided the Compound V2 donation attack by slowly increasing collateral factors, but a recent proposal to add VELO markets opened an exploit window.\nAfter scheduling VELO integration transactions through their permissionless Optimism multisig, the attacker executed the changes and drained $20M by leveraging the well-known vulnerability.\nSonne Finance is working to recover the stolen funds, considering a bug bounty for their return.\nBut it wasn’t all bad news. MEV researcher Tony KΞ from fuzzland posted a play by play of how they prevented more than $6.5M from being hacked during the incident, using just $100.\nOne user noticed something fishy when they posted that Mendi Finance's code is a friendly fork of Sonne Finance.\nCould they be exploited soon?\nSonne was audited by Yearn Finance's yAudit.\nThe attack vector is listed as high finding, stating “Unclear protection against Hundred Finance attack vector.”\nThis latest attack on a Compound v2 fork has speculation floating around that other forked protocols could be exploited\nThis is a known vulnerability that can be easily prevented, hopefully this latest incident will put this on other forked protocol’s radars.\nDo you think they will do their due diligence or will we see more similar attacks?\n\nThe $20 million attack on Sonne Finance represents a major breach enabled by failure to properly address a well-known vulnerability.\nDespite explicit warnings from previous incidents like the Hundred Finance exploit, Sonne's team pushed ahead with integrating new markets without comprehensive safeguards against the donation attack vector.\nThis oversight, coupled with loosely configured governance permissions, allowed the attacker to drain millions with relative ease.\nThe fact that auditors had explicitly flagged this risk as high-severity makes this incident even more inexcusable and concerning.\nAs speculation swirls around other Compound V2 forks potentially being exposed to the same exploit, the incident serves as a wakeup call.\nPrioritizing swift deployments over comprehensive security reviews is a trade-off no protocol can afford, as Sonne has learned the hard way.\nFor DeFi to reach maturity, teams must move past blindly copying code they don't fully understand.\nRigorous pre-launch audits, real-time monitoring for attack vectors, and recovery mechanisms are essential. Otherwise, the ecosystem will remain trapped in a cycle of relearning the same costly lessons with each keystroke.\nThe burning question is whether Sonne's $20 million lesson will be the final straw that forces positive change or will the acceptable loss figures simply keep increasing until major investors and users lose faith altogether?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Even pickles have a shelf life.\nThe Pickle Finance cDAI jar was hacked for 19.7 million DAI via a vulnerability involving fake “Pickle Jars”.\nPickle Finance has become the latest victim of the hack epidemic.\nHowever, this time, something is different...\nAs Twitter tried to come to terms with yet another financial fatality, Rekt started to investigate.\nWe contacted the Stake Capital team, who looked at the code and warned us that other jars could be at risk.\nWe then quickly contacted the Pickle Finance team and set up a war room between members of Stake Capital (@bneiluj, @vasa_develop)  Yearn (@bantg) Pickle Finance and experienced developers @samczsun, @emilianobonassi.\nAs we worked, it became clear we were looking at something very different to the recent DeFi lego style hacks of recent weeks.\nThis was not an arb.\nThe attacker had excellent knowledge of Solidity and EVM, and had likely been paying close attention to the Yearn code for some time, as the vulnerability was similar to one which was discovered in the Yearn code a month earlier.\nPickle Jars are essentially a fork of Yearn’s yVaults. These Jars are controlled by a contract called the Controller, which has a function that allows users to swap their assets between Jars.\nUnfortunately, there is no whitelist for which Jars are allowed to use this swapping function.\nThe hacker had created a fake Pickle Jar and swapped the funds from the original jar. This was possible because the swapExactJarForJar didn’t check for \"whitelisted\" jars.\nThe Pickle Finance team knew they needed help, and were more than willing to work with the others to prevent any further damage.\nPickle had tried to call “withdrawAll”, but the transaction failed.\nThe withdrawal request had to pass through the Governance DAO which had a 12 hour timelock.\nOnly one member of the Pickle multisig had the ability to bypass the timelock, and they were asleep.\nThis meant admins couldn’t empty the Pickle Jars, but it didn’t protect them from another hack.\nPickle Finance and Curve sent out warnings telling users to withdraw their funds from Pickle immediately, however, $50 million remained in the potentially vulnerable pickle jars, while the white hat team investigated the exploit and checked the safety of remaining funds.\nThe rescue team either had to wake the sleeping admin, or drain the jars themselves.\n\nThe team had to overcome five major challenges.\nTo get the Pickle Finance team together across several time zones to start rescuing the funds by pushing transactions into 12h timelock (via 3 out of 6 multisig) to withdraw funds.\nTo get thousands of investors to withdraw their funds (and discourage them from redepositing once the pool TVL dropped and the APY inflated to 1000+% APY)\nPerforming safety checks on the other jars to see if there is a possibility of more attacks.\nDuplicating the attack and whitehacking before anyone can hack the jars again.\nAvoiding getting front-runned when trying to rescue the remaining 50k\nHow long can we continue to rely on pseudo anonymous white hat hackers for help?\nThe incentives are clearly more aligned for attackers than protectors; why would they co-ordinate such a gruelling counter attack?\nThe glory goes to whitehacks, yet the money goes to hackers. That’s not sustainable.\nHow long until the temptation turns these white hats black?\nAnalysis\nBy releasing this technical information we are aware that we could be triggering new hacks. We discussed the potential consequences with Pickle Finance and other developers, and confirmed that we do not know of any operational forks of Pickle that could be affected by copycat attacks.\nSelective disclosure would introduce an aspect of liability, so we decided to release this information freely. If any protocols are running a fork of Pickle’s code, they should already be aware of the unfolding events and be taking preventative action against copycat hacks.\nThe following chart was created by @vasa_develop.\n\nThe original file can be found here.\nFor further details see the teams full post-mortem here.\nIt will be interesting to see how the relatively new insurance primitive “Cover Protocol” handles this incident; a large amount for their first claim. The snapshot vote for the insurance claim can be found here.\n\nPickling is a slow process.\nFor decades, agile development evangelists have told developers to move fast, fail quickly and release the minimum viable product.\nThese ideas don’t fit the bill when building in a hostile environment.\nFailing quickly in DeFi comes at great expense.\nWe don’t simply need another methodology. We need a paradigm shift allowing for rapid iteration while reducing the likelihood of getting rekt at the same time.\nLet’s eliminate the idea that an audit is a guarantee for safety. It is – most of the time – a snapshot of checklist-style security measures applied to moving targets that have often evolved into something else shortly after a project hits mainnet.\nThe audits from MixBytes (October 3rd) and Haechi (October 20th) were completed before the addition of ControllerV4 (October 23rd), which was one of the key attack vectors.\nThe greatest teams in the future of finance will be those capable of handling the trade-offs between shipping fast and shipping safely, continuously auditing and rigorously testing their composable money robots on a regular basis.\nAudits should be a regular and continuous process, not a box to be ticked before launch. New DeFi protocols are subject to constant change and adaptation, and safety audits should reflect this.\nPickles only stay fresh when they’re inside the jar...\nphoto @martinkrung \nEDIT - 18th July 2021.\nHaechi reached out to us with the following statement:\nWe audited a part of Pickle’s contracts, but the exploit occurred in newly updated smart contracts. The smart contract with the exploit was “swapExactJarForJar” in “controller-v4.sol”, and our scope of the audit was “controller-v3.sol” without “swapExactJarForJar”.You can find the details here.\n(FYI) I checked that your team mentioned that our audit for pickle finance was completed before the addition of ControllerV4 which was the key attack vector for this hack.\nYou can find the details here.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

UwuLend's fallback oracle calculated prices based on the state of several Curve pools.\nThe attacker could manipulate the pool states by making large trades with the borrowed tokens.\nThis manipulated the price feed, allowing the attacker to borrow sUSDe at 0.99 but liquidate positions at the inflated 1.03 rate.\n\nAttacker:\n0x841ddf093f5188989fa1524e7b893de64b421f47\nAttack transactions:\n0x242a0fb4fde9de0dc2fd42e8db743cbc197ffa2bf6a036ba0bba303df296408b\n0xb3f067618ce54bc26a960b660cfc28f9ea0315e2e9a1a855ede1508eb4017376\n0xca1bbf3b320662c89232006f1ec6624b56242850f07e0f1dadbe4f69ba0d6ac3\nThe stolen funds are parked in the following two addresses:\n0x48d7c1dd4214b41eda3301bca434348f8d1c5eb6\n0x050c7e9c62bf991841827f37745ddadb563feb70\nOne person was hit harder than most, Michael Egorov the founder of Curve was robbed of just over 23.5 million CRV ($9.85M) that he deposited into UwuLend.\nThe attacker deposited the tokens into Curve’s Llama Lend and borrowed just over 8 million crvUSD ($8.11M).\nThanks to the diligent lenders of crvUSD in LlamaLend's CRV market, the hacker's position was fully hard-liquidated as the lenders repaid the debt, being one of the little silver lining of this event by proving the robustness of the platform.\nThe situation and effects are being unpacked and analyzed in real time in the Curve Social Telegram channel.\nSifu extended an on-chain olive branch to the attacker, proposing a 20% white hat bounty if they cooperate by June 12, 17:00 UTC.\nPost-deadline, the bounty will shift gears, rewarding anyone who can expose and help bring the exploiter to justice.\nSomeone else sent an onchain message to the hacker with instructions on how to move the funds without getting caught.\nThe same address has sent messages in the past to the exploiter of Gala Games, PlayDapp and Exactly Protocol to name a few.\nUwuLend was audited by Peckshield, who characterized the code as “well designed and engineered,” with “no high-severity or critical issues” detected.\nHow did such a critical oracle vulnerability go uncaught by the auditors?\n\nThe $19.4 million UwuLend exploit leaves more questions than answers.\nDespite a recent security audit, a seemingly elementary oracle vulnerability paved the way for one of 2024's most bizarre thefts.\nWith the attacker's identity still shrouded in mystery, suspicion has fallen on Sifu, who appears to be a common thread in multiple crypto crime scenes.\nQuestions linger about UwuLend's choice to rely on DEX prices as a fallback oracle.\nAs conspiracy theories swirl, it remains unclear if the UwuLend attack was an unfortunate lapse in security or something more nefarious.\nThe overlapping breadcrumb trail of Sifu's involvement, the unorthodox oracle design, and the enigmatic on-chain instruction adds further intrigue.\nWho is the shadowy figure instructing exploiters and are there other cryptic connections that have yet to be uncovered or is it just somebody trying to exploit the attacker?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Only users using the front-end could swap\nThe front-end was kept password-protected until the moment the buyback went live, and once the liquidity migrated from TraderJoe was added to the pool, it became clear that a massive price hike had been created as the pooled ratios determined a new SDOG price of ~$70k.\nA list of transactions from the first few minutes in the pool can be found here.\nThe first two transactions were the clear winners, picking up around 40% of the spoils between them.\nTx1 - 187.8 SDOG for 10.4M MIM (SDOG price of ~$55k) from this address, funded via FTX the day before.\nTx2 - 215.1 SDOG for 7.7M MIM (SDOG price of ~$36k) from this address, also funded via FTX the day before.\nThese two transactions sold a total of 403 SDOG for approximately $18M, which would have been worth a mere $500k at pre-buyback rates.\nHowever the “joy” referred to in Snowdog’s explanation of the incident quickly turned to “deception” for the vast majority of users who were left either selling their tokens below the previous market price or holding while watching their value nosedive.\n36 seconds after the front-end reveal, $SDOG market price was already lower than the market price before buyback ($1200).\nThe report goes on to defend the use of the custom liquidity pool by drawing attention to the number of failed botted transactions at the time of the launch. However, suspicion began to build over the earliest trades, and the likelihood of them being an inside job:\nThe two first and most profitable trades are from brand-new addresses (one, two), funded within hours of each other on the day before the buyback. The accounts were funded via FTX, so are likely KYC’d.\nThe accounts appeared to have prior knowledge that the buyback would happen on a new DEX, not having approved SDOG for trading on TraderJoe in advance but approving the custom pool as soon as it was published.\nThe contract’s challengeKey, introduced in order to disrupt sniping bots, is a further source of suspicion given that team members would know the details of this mechanism and have privileged access to the contract directly before the front-end went live.\n\nSnowbank and Snowdog have attempted to capture the two extremes of the current crypto zeitgeist on Avalanche.\nCombining dogcoin FOMO with the aim to establish a reserve currency backed by protocol owned liquidity is ambitious to say the least. And the anon team’s attempt to join these two popular but opposing narratives has backfired, given how the Snowdog “experiment” has affected Snowbank’s token price.\nThat’s one botched buyback, and two projects rekt by the same team.\nIt seems the response to yesterday’s events has tightened Snowbank’s leash with regard to further launches, despite initially using the hype to tease upcoming products.\nAs for any future success of SDOG as Avalanche's answer to DOGE, and Snowbank as its reserve currency, only time will tell.\nWas this a gamed buyback, representing a slightly more sophisticated form of the everyday rugpull?\nOr was it simply the bubble popping on what was never meant to be anything more than an experimental memecoin?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

It extended into sophisticated financial strategies involving token swaps and cross-chain transfers.\nThe exploiter is still holding 996 Billion CGT.

The compensation program will consist of 4 consecutive stages, each lasting for 90 days.\nThey will be developing and deploying a patch to address the identified vulnerability in the voting power privilege access control. Claiming this patch will undergo rigorous testing to ensure its effectiveness in mitigating similar exploits in the future.\nAlong with that, they plan to enhance Curio DAO's smart contract security through upgrades that enforce stricter access controls, audit the code, and add extra layers of security validation to avoid future exploits.\nNo known audits could be found and it appears Curio may be doing their security in house.\nIt was mentioned in the exploit recovery strategy, Curio is relying on internal expertise and leveraging best practices in smart contract development and security auditing.\nCurio DAO is offering a reward structure to white hat hackers, based on proceeds from the initial recovery phase, 10% of the proceeds recovered during the first week and 5% after that, until May 25th.\nDo you believe Curio would have been better protected by having external audits, instead of keeping things in house?\n\nSpring brought more than just flowers for Curio, not only wiping out $16M, but essentially retiring their original CGT token.\nOn the bright side, CurioDAO's two-stage compensation plan with a new token, CGT 2.0,may patch things up a bit.\nWhile Curio claims the exploit was contained to their Ethereum playground, the exploiter is still sitting on 996 Billion CGT tokens.\nMaybe the attacker just got started and will find a way to swap across chains for a complex financial game.\nWill Curio's promise to revamp smart contract security calm any brewing distrust? Time will tell.\nIf they’re going to keep security in-house, it may not be the best strategy, as highlighted by this attack.\nLaunching projects into the wild without proper security due diligence is setting yourself up for failure.\nAre finding risks after the fact becoming too common, or just an indication that the industry needs to invest more in preventive measures and proactive security strategies?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Each index pool has its own token whose price should be a weighted average of the underlying assets.\nAt 18:37 UTC on October 14th, an attack took place targeting the DEFI5 and CC10 pools. The “Future of Finance Fund” (FFF) was also heavily affected, given that DEFI5 and CC10 tokens make up 37.05% of its underlying assets.\nMore details of the exploit can be found in the official post-mortem as well as in Mudit Gupta’s twitter thread.\nDillon Kellar; the sole developer responsible for writing the original code of Indexed Finance, has made his thoughts public in a Tweet thread.\nThe code governing the index pools is forked from the Balancer Pool contract. This allows for the internal rebalancing of assets within the pool on a constant product curve.\nThe function extrapolatePoolValueFromToken is based on the “first token in the pool with a target weight over 0 and which is fully initialized” to calculate the total value of the pool.\ntotal_value = token_balance * total_weight / token_weight\nIn order to control slippage, the rate at which the resulting changes in weights are enacted within the pool is limited, creating a temporary discrepancy ripe for manipulation.\nThe attacker’s address was funded via Tornado Cash hours before the attack:\n0xba5ed1488be60ba2facc6b66c6d6f0befba22ebe\nBoth the DEFI and CC10 pools were attacked in the same way, see this transaction for the attack on the DEFI5 pool.\nThe attacker was able to take advantage of the above by using flash loans of the other assets in the pool to buy out UNI, decreasing the extrapolated value due to the delay in updating UNI’s weight decrease.\nThis was done gradually, as the “pool does not allow swaps to send more than 1/2 of the pool’s existing balance in a token or purchase more than 1/3 of the pool’s balance in a token”.\nAfter calling the updateMinimumBalance function using the gamed pool value, the controller valued the pool at just 29,851 SUSHI (~$300k), “despite the pool having received over a hundred million dollars worth of other assets”.\nOnce prepared, the attacker could deposit relatively small amounts of (now heavily over-weighted) SUSHI into the pool, minting a massively inflated number of DEFI5 tokens in return.\nThese were subsequently cashed out for the assets in the pool.\n\nIn total, about $16M of a variety of assets were stolen by the attacker, at the time of writing they remain in this address.\nIn a follow up to the official post-mortem, Doctor Day has put out a statement:\nThe knife twist is that we've realised that we believe that we actually know who did this: we spoke to them quite a bit prior to the execution of this attack.\nStarting on the 15th of September, we were approached by a Discord user under the name 'UmbralUpsilon' (currently BogHolder#1688), asking some questions about the way in which certain parameters were utilised in the oracle. Since every component of Indexed is open-source, we answered these questions, and upon asking the reason, were told that they were attempting to create an arbitrage bot for the pools.\nThis is a key part of how Indexed generates revenue (exit fees on burns when arbitraging the NAV of tokens and their value on DEXes), and we were happy to engage with queries about the mechanics, explaining how reindexes work, the timing of reweights, how tokens are added and removed from candidate asset lists, and so on. We had no reason to be alarmed: all of these conversations were in the spirit of open-source collaboration.\nWe are aware (courtesy of @pcaversaccio) that the exploiter requested some Kovan testnet Ether via Gitter, using the (dead, presumably created for the purposes of the assault) Twitter account @ZetaZeroes. We have reached out to them via Gitter with the following message.\n\nWe speak now directly to the exploiter, if they ever read this: you’re clearly incredibly skilled: this is something that has been overlooked for ten months in production, and you’re the only one that found it. While it would have been so much more productive for you to instead choose to work with us: be the antihero of this story rather than the villain. Take a 10% whitehat, and save a lot of people the effort of engaging law enforcement.\nThe people that are affected by this are those that are trying to diversify risk within a volatile space. That’s part of what makes this particularly cruel: no one deserves to have their funds whisked away, but the context here is an irony that can’t be ignored.\nOur door’s open, and it’ll make a much more satisfying footnote to our appearance on rekt.news.\n\nWise words from the Doxxed Doctor, who’s been put in the hot seat through no fault of his own.\nThe damage dealt by these attackers is not just financial.\nNo DeFi developer should have to receive death threats.\nIs anonymity the only way to stay safe?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Tsuka was also affected, but experienced less price impact due to a secondary liquidity pool on Uniswap v3.\nThe project’s website claims to protect over $2.5B of assets, but considering the low liquidity of their selection of shitcoins, we can consider this claim to be optimistic at best.\n#46 on the leaderboard.\nTeamwork.\n\nCredit: Peckshield\nThe announcement of the hack explained that the exploit targeted “the audited v2 to v3 migration function.”\nThe vulnerability was contained in one of the Liquidity Locks’ “bulletproof smart contracts” which allowed projects to migrate locked LP positions from Uni v2 to Uni v3.\nAccording to Peckshield’s analysis:\nThe protocol has a flawed migrate() that is exploited to transfer real UniswapV2 liquidity to an attacker-controlled new V3 pair with skewed price, resulting in huge leftover as the refund for profit. Also, the authorized sender check is bypassed by locking any tokens.\n\nThe breakdown of the loss to each project’s Uniswap v2 pool is as follows:\n$11.5M CAW\n$1.7M TSUKA\n$0.7M KNDX\n$1.9M FEG\nExploiter address 1: 0x161cebb807ac181d5303a4ccec2fc580cc5899fd\nExploiter address 2 (containing stolen funds): 0xba399a2580785a2ded740f5e30ec89fb3e617e6e\nAttack tx: 0xb2e3ea72…\nAttacker’s contract: 0xcff07c4e6aa9e2fec04daaf5f41d1b10f3adadf4\nThe vulnerable migrate() function was included in Zokyo Security’s audit of Team Finance contracts from August this year.\n\n“DAO tooling” was amongst the most popular buzzwords throughout the last cycle.\nFor small, anon teams working on innovative protocols, it may be tempting to outsource trust to a third party.

If you’re a DeFi detective with skills to share, then reach out and tell us about your experience - we might have a spot for you here at rekt.news.\nA hacker hit back with a counter attack, broke Furucombo and knocked out $14 million from various wallets who had given the app “infinite approval”.\nInfinite approval means unlimited trust - something which we know we shouldn’t do in DeFi.\n“Don’t trust, verify”, but who has time or the cash for gas to approve set amounts each time they transact?\nPeople who used Furucombo had to give some amount of approval, but it seems too many gave too much, and they received a harsh lesson in return.\n\nIn what is known as an “evil contract” exploit, the attacker made the Furucombo proxy contract think that Aave V2 had a new implementation.\nThe new implementation was, of course, malicious, and had the ability to transfer all approved tokens to addresses controlled by the attacker, as users had approved the Furucombo contracts to use their tokens on their behalf.\nKurt Barry provided an analysis:\nOne of the fund stealing transactions was sent to the Furucombo proxy, specifying the AAVE v2 Lending Pool proxy as the \"handler\" for the first and only action.\nYou can see the execution trace below, as shown on ethtx.info. Notice the nested delegatecalls.\n\nHandlers must be approved in a registry; at the time of the transaction (but not at present), this proxy was a valid handler.\n\nThe FC proxy delegatecalls the AAVE v2 proxy, which then reads out the implementation address from a special storage slot, but as this is a delegatecall, it reads from the storage of the FC proxy, and the extracted address is the hacker's exploit contract.\n\nIf we look at the hacker's previous transaction:\nWe see that the hacker used their malicious contract to make the FC proxy delegatecall to the AAVE v2 proxy, invoking the initialize function, setting the implementation slot.\n\n\nOnce the delegatecall executed the hacker's code in the FC proxy's context, it was all over. The victim had approved the FC proxy to move their stETH, and the exploit code sent it all to the hacker.\nRinse and repeat for the rest.\nSummary:\nWhat have we learnt:\nIt wasn’t just individuals who lost out, even Cream Finance suffered a loss, as the attacker “borrowed” directly from their treasury.\n\nIgor Igamberdiev gave a list of the assets which were stolen.\n\nWe spoke to DeFi enthusiast Limzero (@pleyuh) after we found out he was one of the worst affected.\nrekt:\nHow did the situation play out for you?\nHow did you realise Furucombo was being attacked and when did you take action?\nLimzero:\nI was chilling with some friends in my home. I opened TG from mobile to see what's up and saw from Darren's \"The daily ape\" channel that there was a Furucombo related exploit.\nI checked one of my addresses I had used furucombo from and noticed the transfer of my aAAVE and some aETH.\nI got scared because I had some active loans and didn't want to have my deposits liquidated. I found out that my health factor had dropped to 1.15, so i repaid the loans fast.\nWhat i noticed is that the attacker drained all my aAAVE but only 1/3 of my aETH. I suspect that the low HF blocked them from transferring more funds out. I might have been lucky having active loans.\nAfter I repaid the loans to protect the deposits, I revoked all token permissions I had given from that address.\nThat was an action I was postponing for weeks (for when fees would be lower). Apparently it was a costly delay.\nI noticed the transfer of my funds by the hacker 90m after the hack had taken place.\nrekt:\nWas it a big loss for you?\nHow did it feel psychologically, do you feel more cautious or less confident about using DeFi after the attack?\nLimzero:\nIt was a big loss in absolute numbers but nothing my portfolio couldn't survive.\nI got very scared for a couple of minutes as I was afraid that all my aTokens could have gotten liquidated, when I saw my health factor above 1.1 I felt relief.\nI treat the whole experience as an expensive security lesson- having infinite allowances on from an address with large amounts was a very silly mistake by my side. All things considered, that was an ape tax I had to pay eventually. It's the first smart contract hack / exploit that affects me after so many years in the space. I feel lucky that more serious situations haven't touched me yet.\nActually the first exploit after the COVER exploit but I forgot about that :P\nI do not feel less confident about using DeFi. These kinds of risks were known.\nI have taken measures to increase my cyber security though.\nrekt:\nWhat can you tell us about these measures?\nLimzero:\nI'd rather not say sorry.\nIt's part of the measures  😋\nrekt:\nWhat steps would you recommend our readers take to improve their security?\nLimzero:\nI am not a security expert by any means. These are standard guidelines suggested by more knowledgeable people in crypto.\nrekt:\nAny final message for our readers?\nLimzero:\n\"Please don't hack me again\"\nAlso, unless you feel very confident about your security, consider keeping a small fraction of your holdings on top tier CEXes like Kraken, Coinbase, Gemini, Binance in case your personal wallets get hacked.\nThat's all from me.\nrekt:\nThanks for talking to us.\nLimzero:\nThank you! I hope we never talk again lol.\nA simple attack with a simple fix - don’t use “infinite approve” unless you have unlimited trust. Individual approvals are no small expense, but don’t cut costs when it comes to security.\nSites such as Debank or Etherscan allow you to monitor and revoke your wallet approvals, and as Limzero stated, this is not a task that should be delayed until another day.\nNever drop your guard, hackers are always looking for an opening, and these attacks occur much more regularly than you might expect.\nThere’s no referee inside this ring; you are responsible for your own safety, but once you learn the ropes, the prize money is worth the risk.\n\nEDIT: 18th July 2021:\nHaechi reached out to us with the following statement:\nAlthough their contract(proxy) was in our scope of audit, the exploit that infected the proxy was not our scope of the audit.\nWhat furucombo team provided to us was only two contracts; furucombo proxy and compound adapter. So their scenario that furucombo team has provided is accessing the compound protocol using a compound adapter with proxy, that’s all.\nBut, as you know, the exploit was caused by the scenario of using AAVE. We were not able to find this issue since they already had whitelist functionality which should have worked as a guard for this kind of situation.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Four minutes before the main attack transaction, a separate transaction was able to “fake” a swap of ~2M USDC to 100k DEI.\nThe funds necessary to finance this manipulation were initially withdrawn from Tornado Cash before being sent on to the exploiter’s address, swapped for $2M USDC and then sent via Multichain to Fantom (example tx: send, receive).\nIn what Tabor claims to be a “a zero-day exploit on Solidly swaps”, a series of flash-swaps inside the same pool outputs a manipulated price, which is read by the Muon oracle.\nHe went on to explain via DM that:\n”we came to the conclusion it all is based on the fact the muon oracle implementation only used Solidly as a price source, they have been working on upgrading that already.\nthe swap used flashswap() that wasnt filtered out properly by muon leading to a short term VWAP price glitch…\n…Main takeaway based on the whitehackers anlysis is to change muon vwap pricing to filter out obscure swaps and use multiple data sources.\"\nAfter having prepared the Muon oracle, at 02:40 UTC, the main attack targeted the USDC/DEI pool used by the lending contract as an on-chain oracle for DEI, using the same process as before.\nCredit: Peckshield\n1: Flashloan 143,200,000 USDC\n2: Swap 143,200,000 USDC to 9,547,716 DEI via sAMM-USDC/DEI_USDC_DEI (so DEI becomes extremely expensive)\n3: With 71,436 DEI as collateral, attacker borrows 17,246,885 DEI from DeiLenderSolidex due to the manipulated price in step 2\n4: Repay flashloan with ~$13M as hack profit\nWhile last month’s attack manipulated collateral price in order to liquidate borrowers, this time, the collateral was used to borrow funds directly from the protocol.\nThe loot (5446 ETH, including the funds used to finance the Muon manipulation) was sent from the attacker’s address on Fantom to Ethereum and then on to Tornado Cash.\nMuon oracle manipulation tx: 0x8589e1…\nMain flashloan attack tx: 0x39825f… \nAttacker’s address (FTM): 0x701428… \nAttacker’s address (ETH): 0x701428…\nDespite this being the second incident to affect the project in as many months, the price of DEUS has returned close to pre-hack prices, after an initial ~20% drop. DEI has been trading under peg since the incident, but appears to be stabilising over time.\n\nGiven the oracle is a new product and the swap vulnerability is allegedly previously unknown, it's no surprise that the Armors Labs’ audit of Deus’ lending product did not pick up the issue.\nHowever, even if the claims of a novel vulnerability are accurate, Tabor’s admissions show that the Muon oracle wasn’t up to task - it shouldn’t have been using a single price source, and had inadequate filtering of “obscure swaps”.\nBoth of these factors will be addressed and, similarly to last time, the project will be covering losses, this time via veDEUS funds.\nThere are reliable, established and already battle-tested options to choose from.\nWhile innovation is admirable, security standards emerged from our baptism of fire.\nLet’s make sure to use them.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Fool me twice, shame on me.\"\nBut what do we say when a project gets fooled twice by similar oversights?\nPerhaps it's time for a new adage: \"Hack me once, shame on the attacker. Hack me twice, shame on my operational security.\"\nLike a digital Paul Revere, Chaofan Shou was the first to sound the alarm on X, alerting everyone that once again, the Ronin bridge was under attack.\nUnlike their previous six-day delayed reaction, this time Ronin was a little quicker on the draw.\nPsycheout.ron, COO of Ronin, responded shortly after the exploit was detected.\n\"The Ronin Network bridge has been paused while we investigate a report from whitehats about a potential MEV exploit. The bridge currently secures over $850M which is safe.\"\nApproximately three hours later, the official Ronin Network account confirmed the exploit, stating that white hats had alerted them and the bridge was paused 40 minutes after the first on-chain action was spotted.\nThey revealed that the attackers had withdrawn just under 4K ETH and 2M USDC, valued at around $12M, which was the maximum single transaction withdrawal limit, a safeguard that prevented further damage.\nAs with many crypto heists, the devil was in the details, or in this case, in the upgrade process.\nVerichains highlighted the root cause of this exploit, a failure to properly initialize a critical parameter during a contract upgrade. Following is how it unfolded.\nThe Fateful Upgrade: On August 6, the Ronin team deployed an update to their bridge manager, moving from version 2 to 4.\nThis upgrade introduced a new implementation contract, MainchainGatewayV3, which was deployed just 6 days prior.\nThe Ronin upgrade hub shows the changes in this new implementation, including modifications to how the contract handles operator weights and withdrawal submissions.\nThe Critical Oversight: In their haste, they called the initializeV4 function but neglected to call initializeV3. This seemingly minor oversight would prove costly.\n\nThe Unintended Consequence: The _totalOperatorWeight variable was left uninitialized, defaulting to zero. This meant that the minimumVoteWeight parameter, crucial for cross-chain verification, was effectively disabled.\n\nThe Exploit: With security checks effectively disabled, the vulnerability was ripe for exploitation. An MEV bot identified the vulnerability and front-ran any potential manual exploit attempts, executing the attack and directing the funds to its own address.\nThe Damage Control: Thanks to a daily withdrawal limit, an additional $72 million was saved from being pilfered. The Ronin team managed to pause the contract about 38 minutes after the exploit began.\nIn a surprising turn of events, the stolen funds were swiftly returned, thanks to lightning-fast MEV white hats who outpaced potential malicious actors.\nThe ETH, valued at approximately $10 million, was promptly sent back to the Ronin team.\nThe remaining USDC was returned shortly after.\nIn recognition of their vigilance and integrity, the Ronin team announced a $500,000 bounty for the white hat hackers involved.\nRonin also stated that the bridge will undergo an audit before reopening, with Ronin aiming to shift its operation away from the current structure.\nA post-mortem is scheduled for next week, promising deeper insights into the technical details and planned preventive measures.\nThis incident highlights the double-edged sword of upgradeable contracts and the critical importance of meticulous implementation.\nRonin's oversight turned a routine upgrade into a $12 million lesson in humility.\nHow many more wake-up calls can a project survive before users decide it's time to cross a different bridge?\n\nDespite their improved response time, Ronin's failure to properly implement and test their latest upgrade reveals a project still stumbling over basic security practices.\nThey dodged a bullet thanks to the fortuitous intervention of MEV white hats, but luck isn't a sustainable security strategy.\nFor a project that's already suffered the largest hack in crypto history, this near-miss should be a final wake-up call.\nIt's time to prioritize rigorous security measures over hasty upgrades.\nMoving forward, Ronin and indeed all blockchain projects should do the following:\nAlways implement thorough tests for contract upgrades.\nCollaborate with auditors to verify correct deployment.\nBe cautious with the Initializable contract from OpenZeppelin, understanding its potential pitfalls.\nRonin Network wobbles precariously between redemption and infamy.\nIn an ecosystem where reputation is as volatile as the assets it secures, how many near-misses can a project survive before users decide to seek safer shores?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

We wanted to know why they had thought that the compounder.finance team seemed ”very trustworthy”\n\nWhen reading the chat logs, we noticed that although the accounts had been deleted, one username remained - “keccak”.\n\n\nAlthough solidity.finance said keccak had deleted their account, we had already found their account and were trying to make contact.\n\nUnfortunately, Vlad didn’t want to talk on the phone, so we sent them a message, not expecting him to respond.\nUntil…\n\nVlad was ready to talk. Unfortunately, he wasn’t very cooperative.\n\nVlad / keccak can still be reached on Telegram via @keccak, however he no longer responds, and has since deleted the images on his account.\nWe attach his old avatars here for your consideration and investigation.\nWe have been informed that - The wolf one is from a famous Ukrainian cartoon in Russian, which says “come by if something comes up”\nThe left one is a anti-nuclear-weapon poster.\nNot much help for the affected users unfortunately.\n\nOnce it became clear Vlad wouldn’t talk, we visited the official Compounder telegram group, where it became apparent that our reputation precedes us.\n\nAs we scrolled through the content of the chat, we saw all the typical behaviours that are caused by a freshly pulled rug.\n\nEven large players are humbled by the power of a rug pull. This group leader lost $1,000,000 and has opened his own investigation group (686 members) in an attempt to have some revenge.\n\nThe thread can be found here.\nThe Statistics\nAs part of our investigation, we introduced Solidity.finance to @vasa_develop from Stake Capital and asked them to work together to create a full post-mortem of the incident.\nThe following data is taken from their report.\nAssets Rugged (8):\nWallets with the funds after rug-pull\n0x944f214a343025593d8d9fd2b2a6d43886fb2474\n0x079667f4f7a0b440ad35ebd780efd216751f0758\nFrom the time the Deployer was first funded via Tornado.cash to the time of the rug pull, the Deployer sent ETH to 7 different addresses. Most of these were one-off payments. One of these addresses, however, received 4 separate payments on Nov 19th, 20th, 22nd, and 23rd. Much of the funds from that address ended up an another address holding over 1 million KORE (Only 10k KORE existed before they rug pulled).\nThe main culprit(s) of this hack were the 7 malicious Strategy contracts that were added to the codebase after the audit.\nA non-malicious withdraw() function from a Strategy contract looks something like this.\n\nNotice that we have some checks like:\n\nThese checks were missing in the 7 malicious Strategy contracts. This allows the Controller contract (which was controlled by the rug-puller strategist) to withdraw the assets from the Strategy.\n(Note the missing checks below in the malicious withdraw function)\n\nThe complete rug-pull can be explained in 4 steps.\nStep 1\nCompounder.Finance: Deployer deployed 7 Malicious Strategies with manipulated withdraw() functions.\nStep 2\nCompounder.Finance: Deployer Set and Approve 7 Malicious Strategies in StrategyController via Timelock (24h) transactions.\nStep 3\nCompounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) called inCaseStrategyTokenGetStuck() on StrategyController which abuse the manipulated withdraw() function of the Malicious Strategies to transfer the tokens in the Strategies to the StrategyController. Do this for all 7 Malicious Strategies.\nStep 4\nCompounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) called inCaseTokensGetStuck() on the StrategyController which transfers the tokens from the StrategyController to the Compounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) address. Now the Compounder.Finance: Deployer (strategist) has full control over 8 assets valued at $12,464,316.329.\nFrom here the assets have been transferred to multiple addresses listed here.\nExcellent work from @vasa_develop.\nIf you are a whistleblower, cyber sleuth or Etherscan detective and you have something to contribute, contact us.\n\nJudgement Day:\nWho is to blame?\nAfter our analysis, we know it’s not the auditors, who dutifully completed their task, making sure that Compounder Finance stayed safe from external attacks, while also voicing their concerns in their audit report and the TG chat.\nPerhaps they could have voiced these concerns slightly louder, but in the end, the ultimate responsibility will always lie with the depositor.\nCompounder.finance used a timelock as an indicator that they wouldn’t pull the rug. We know now that this method can’t be trusted. If it is used, an automated alert system or dashboard should be put in place to monitor transactions at that address.\n24 hours appears to be insufficient to provide enough warning for users to remove funds.\nNot all projects with anonymous founders are scams. This entire industry was founded by an anon.\nHowever, nearly all scams are projects with anonymous founders. As a community, we need to be wary of these projects; especially those who use untraceable sources of funds like Tornado.cash.\nThe mere existence of an audit report is not sufficient to assure a projects' safety or legitimacy. Audits often focus on risks from external attackers more than internal - perhaps this is an area where auditors need to improve.\nEven with audits, timelocks and burnt keys, depositors are always at the mercy of other users, who may dump huge amounts of tokens onto the market at any time.\n\nSolidity.Finance: The Official Statement\nThe Compounder team swapped the safe/audited Strategy contracts and replaced them with malicious 'Evil Strategy' contracts that allowed them to steal users funds. They did this through a public, though clearly unmonitored,  24-hour timelock.\nThis issue of centralized control by the C3PR team was raised in our audit report and our discussions with their team. The team had the power to update strategy pools and they did so maliciously here to steal users’ funds. In an effort to be transparent, anyone can view our chat logs with the C3PR team here: \nHistorically, our audits have focused on the risks to projects from external attackers, with some discussion on risks posed by project teams as we did here. We will take this unfortunate event as a learning opportunity, and moving forward will provide more robust details in easy to understand language on risks stemming from developers’ control.\n\nWe all know we should read smart contracts before we invest, but the knowledge barrier is high. Not everyone knows what to look for, and those who do are not incentivised to share their findings.\nIn the case of C3PR, users who listened were made aware of the danger very early on, and the code that made the rugpull possible was always present.\nDespite this, over $12,000,000 accumulated in the contract, which can now be labelled as one of the largest rug pulls of all time.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Soon after, PrismaFi instructed vault owners to disable delegate approvals.\nAround 4 hours later, PrismaFi announced that the protocol was paused by the emergency multisig and the remaining funds are safe. They also stated mkUSD and ULTRA, as stablecoins, are overcollateralized and are not at risk.\nDecurity detected a copy-cat exploit that someone deployed, but not yet used.\nThe market has been waking up from its extended winter, but with that, the attacks are increasing.\nPrismaFi is a fork of the Liquity Protocol, with some changes to the code. Liquity claims the exploit on Prisma is not replicable on Liquity.\nWith restaking being a hot trend lately and this being the first exploit on a restaking protocol, could restaking exploits become a hot trend as well?\n\nCredit: Cyvers, Prisma Finance, Decurity, ExVul, Nick Franklin\nAccording to ExVul's root cause analysis, the exploit occurred due to a vulnerability in the MigrateTroveZap contract. This contract is designed to automate the migration process between different versions of Trove Managers for the same collateral.\nThe contract's onFlashloan() function lacked proper input validation, allowing the attacker to manipulate input data. By doing so, the attacker could trigger the closeTrove and openTrove functions on arbitrary addresses, even those not owned by the attacker.\n\nIn the exploit transaction, the attacker targeted a specific address and closed its trove, resulting in the MigrateTroveZap contract being refunded with 1745 wstETH.\n\nSubsequently, the attacker opened a new trove, spending 463 wstETH.\n\nAfter the onFlashloan callback execution, around 1282 wstETH remained in the MigrateTroveZap contract. The attacker then opened their own trove and called MigrateTroveZap to migrate it, using the remaining 1282 wstETH for their own trove. Finally, the attacker closed the trove and extracted the profits from the exploit.\n\nThe exploiter was able to gain $11.6M after several successful attacks.\nAttacker Contract: 0xD996073019c74B2fB94eAD236e32032405bC027c\nAttacker Address: 0x7E39E3B3ff7ADef2613d5Cc49558EAB74B9a4202\nAttack Transaction: 0x00c503b595946bccaea3d58025b5f9b3726177bbdc9674e634244135282116c7\nFunds transferred to:\n0x5d0064f3B54C8899Ab797445551058Be460C03C6\n0x57f7033F84894770F876bf64772E7EBA48990D65\n0x2d413803a6eC3Cb1ed1a93BF90608f63b157507a\nAttack flow of funds can be found here.\nOne of the addresses where funds were sent, left a message stating “this is a white hat rescue” and asked to contact someone to offer a refund.\nNick Franklin highlighted that 5 days before the attack, an address approved the MigrateTroveZap contract for migration here and here. Could this have been prevented?\nPrismaFi has indicated further steps will include a Post-Mortem and attempts to retrieve funds. No word on a timeline.\nThere were 3 audits conducted, MixBytes in September 2023, Nomoi in early 2024 and Zellic in July of 2023. Since the MigrateTroveZap contract migration was within the past week, there is no word on this particular contract being audited recently.\nWith a trail of audits in its wake, PrismaFi's MigrateTroveZap contract may have slipped through the cracks.\nDo you think PrismaFi did their due diligence?\n\nIn the high-stakes world of DeFi, even the \"end game\" can be gamified.\nThe PrismaFi exploit marks the first known attack on a restaking protocol, possibly opening Pandora's box for future incidents.\nA part of the story may have yet to unfold, the copy-cat exploit someone deployed, but have yet to use. Could this be foreshadowing?\nAs restaking platforms gain traction, the DeFi community must stay sharp, prioritizing security and constant vigilance against emerging threats.\nThe PrismaFi incident serves as another cautionary tale, reminding us that hype and growth can attract bad actors and vigilantes eager to exploit vulnerabilities.\nGranted, new innovations come from experimenting, but trial running in real time, with real funds, as opposed to doing everything possible in a testing environment is a dangerous game.\nAs we chase innovation, maybe we are gambling too much with the security of users' funds.\nWill we learn from our mistakes or continue to play Russian Roulette with our digital fortunes?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Later Yearn vault contracts are not affected.\nDespite a last-minute warning on Twitter, immutable contracts can’t be saved.\nTeam member storming0x acknowledged the attack before Yearn reassured users that current contracts were unaffected.\n1156 days to spot a multimillion dollar vulnerability in one of DeFi’s longest established protocols.\nHow did it take so long?\n\nCredit: Samczsun, OtterSec, SlowMist\nThe attacker exploited a misconfiguration in the iearn yUSDT token contract.\nThe token generated yield via an underlying basket of yield-bearing tokens, including USDT positions on Aave, Compound, DYDX and BzX’s Fulcrum.\nHowever, since launch, the yUSDT has contained what appears to be a copy/paste error whereby the Fulcrum USDC address was used instead of the Fulcrum USDT contract.\nThe exploiter was able to take advantage of the misconfiguration to vastly manipulate the underlying share prices of yUSDT, and mint a large quantity (1.2 quadrillion) of yUSDT using just 10k USDT.\nTheori’s junomon.eth provided the step-by-step analysis:\n\nExploiter address 1: 0x5bac20beef31d0eccb369a33514831ed8e9cdfe0\nExploiter address 2: 0x16af29b7efbf019ef30aae9023a5140c012374a5\nExploiter address 3: 0x6f4a6262d06272c8b2e00ce75e76d84b9d6f6ab8\nAttack transaction 1: 0xd55e43c1…\nAttack transaction 2: 0x8db0ef33…\nThe minted yUSDT was then swapped for other stables totalling $11.4M, BlockSec provided the following breakdown:\n\nThe attacker was funded via Tornado Cash and redeposited 1000 ETH for laundering. At the time of writing, the first two exploiter addresses contain approximately $1.5M of assets each, and address 3 contains 7.4M DAI.\nCertik conducted an audit of iearn finance in Feb 2020, however it appears that only the yDAI contract was investigated.\n\nThe test in prod attitude, Cronje’s preferred method, has been responsible for plenty of incidents, providing much of rekt.news’ early content.\nGenerally, though, new protocols and features got rekt within hours or days, not years…\nIn the wake of each attack, a decentralised monopoly began to grow.\nThe wider Cronje-verse has experienced enough incidents to have its own leaderboard, as we discussed after CREAM Finance was hacked for the second time, in October 2021.\nDespite the significant losses, it’s lucky that this case only affected an old and deprecated strategy, and didn’t threaten the $450M of TVL across current Yearn strategies.\nAs we wrote last time:\nNo protocol is too big to fail.\nFirst Sushi, now Yearn.\nIt’s a big week for DeFi stalwarts getting rekt.\nWho will be next?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

First of all, the attacker sends a small amount of a second token to pair addresses\n2. They then make a swap in which they want to withdraw a small amount of the first token and a large amount of the second token.\n3. Due to incorrect use of the Bancor formula, the pair contracts consider the swap to be successful. (root of exploit)\nStolen funds:\nCredit: frankresearcher\n\nNote the power() routine takes four arguments (baseN, baseD, expN, and expD) and is used to calculate an integer approximation of (baseN/baseD)^(expN/expD)*(2^precision) where precision is used for the calculated result. However, there is a caveat in how this power() function should be used. It makes an explicit assumption that baseN must be no less than baseD, i.e., baseN >= baseD. In this attack, the pool’s swap() function is called with a crafted input that intentionally violates the above assumption. As a result, the weighted constant product enforcement is passed while the pool funds are being drained.\nCredit: peckshield\n\nDespite achieving their third place on our leaderboard, the native token of Value DeFi has recovered somewhat since the latest exploit. However, Nansen shows us that the DEX volume has been decreasing consistently.\n\n\nWill another rebrand save the most hacked protocol from losing all their users, or is this the end for Value DeFi?\nThe Value DeFi team were reassuring users of the safety of their platform only hours before the latest exploit, tweeting about increased security measures which clearly had zero impact.\nGoing forward, it’s hard to see how anyone could trust the anonymous developers, who admitted to using a paid actress on fiverr to play the role of their founder, and when they were confronted about it by a user, responded with something similar to;\nThe girl we caption as our co-founder in that video is actually just a paid actress, but one of our devs happened to go by that online alias, so then we coincidentally tracked down an actress by that same name on Fiverr to feature in our video!\nApe tax is high for users of Value DeFi, the least secure DeFi protocol. Who can have any sympathy for users of such blatant low quality projects?\nWe’re very thankful for all the new readers that Value DeFi has brought us over the recent months, but hopefully this will be the last time.\nAlthough we ridicule the repetitive failures of the founders, these are not their funds that are being stolen. If they plan to continue their operations, then they will have to try much harder.\nInstead of focusing on fake communications, focus on real users safety, not piling up worthless security audits.\nOr maybe it’s time to call it quits and stop putting users funds at risk.\nCan Value DeFi close their operations safely, or will we soon see a final exit scam?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

An arbitrage attack on the Yearn DAI v1 vault shows that even our most experienced developers can still make mistakes.\nThe vault was attacked using 9 flash loans. $11 million was lost from the vault, $2.7m of which went to the attacker, $3.5m went to Curve liquidity providers, $3.5m went to Curve stakers, and $1.4m was paid in Aave v2 fees.\nDeFi systems are in constant flux. Increasingly intertwined protocols create an infinite machine with countless moving parts.\nThe development of our industry moves at breakneck speed, and new ideas and potential attack vectors are uncovered everyday.\nA constantly changing environment means even time tested products can’t guarantee absolute security.\nFalling victim to an arbitrageur must be humiliating for the team who were once seen as unbeatable, but there is no pleasure to be taken from pointing out flaws in the work of developers who create so much value in our field.\nThe Yearn team have issued their version of a post-mortem, although flashloans are not mentioned.\nIgor Igamberdiev gave a more detailed analysis of the attack on Twitter.\nAttacker profit:\n- 513k DAI\n- 1.7M USDT\n- remaining 506k 3CRV (~$1)\nThe attacker executed 11 transactions.\n1/ Flash loaned 116k ETH from dYdX\n2/ Flash loaned 99k ETH from Aave v2\n3/ Borrow 134M USDC and 129M DAI using ETH as collateral on Compound\n4/ Add 134M USDC and 36M DAI to 3crv Curve pool\n5/ Withdraw 165M USDT from 3crv Curve pool\n6/ Repeat five times\n- Deposit 93M DAI to yDAI vault (less w/ each time)\n- Add 165M USDT to 3crv pool\n- Withdraw 92M DAI from yDAI vault (less w/ each time)\n- Withdraw 165M USDT from 3crv pool\n7/ In the last time withdraw 39M DAI and 134M USDC instead USDT\n8/ Repay Compound debts\n9/ Repay flash loans\nEach time the attacker had more 3crv tokens, which he was later able to swap for stablecoins.\nAttacker contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x62494b3ed9663334e57f23532155ea0575c487c5Attac\nTornado TX #1\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x7ee28e342573ff7b8fb4bd2e4373e742cf80d8f8c7f8764cc6b70439dc33f037\nTornado TX #2\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x13c12895d44f8b890af2187b93b97bec01dd34eeb026ac9669d8412e57d64446\nTornado TX #3\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x6b07e3faaa419ea5a3d58929e07b872f8529441064eb576d61ef5edd697f7256\nTornado TX #4\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xcacdc95bd65556426bae39025ddb1deafb65acb908be49fb7186bb750f7a369f\nThe profit opportunity was created because the withdrawal fee had been turned off for vault migration.\nReaders will know there’s nothing new about flash loan attacks, and so will Yearn developers, who are competent enough to have prevented this from happening, suggesting this was just an opportunist taking advantage of a mistake made during the vault migration.\nGossip and drama remains high in the DeFi community; and many considered this attack to be a reprisal for Cronje’s earlier accusations of hypocrisy against Julien Bouteloup; one of the contributors to Stake DAO.\n\nAlthough many of our readers (and your anonymous author) would secretly enjoy watching such a battle between the two developers, these accusations were proven to be false as the attackers account was funded and the contract written hours before this criticism was made.\n\nAs two of the most prominent developers in our industry, there is bound to be some competition. Passion for their work and the responsibility of tying your reputation to code housing hundreds of millions of dollars puts working relationships under huge amounts of stress.\nIt’s also worth remembering that not all of our best developers are on Twitter.\nIf a DeFi protocol receives refunds from a centralised company, at what point does it stop being DeFi?\nTether has frozen 1.7M USDT that was stolen during the hack. In the past, Tether has reimbursed users who mistakenly lost money by sending tokens to the contract address.\nIf Tether burns these stolen tokens and mints the equivalent in order to return the funds to Yearn, then they are no different to any central bank.\nYearn developer @fubuloubu has spoken out against the use of Tether in the past, but seems to have changed his mind after their intervention.\n\n\nWe all love decentralisation when it brings us profit, but refunds are best served centralised.\nThis attack went straight to the heart of one of the biggest DeFi conglomerates, shaking the foundations of what was once seen as an impenetrable fortress.\nEven the best in the business make mistakes, but this should not deter us from encouraging them to build.\nWhen tensions are high and DeFi teams begin to take sides against one another, we would all do well to zoom out and look at the bigger picture.\nWe build weapons against traditional finance. We should not oppress the flow of innovation by fighting amongst ourselves, when the real fight is us vs them.\nEventually we will look back on this period with nothing but respect for all those who shared the vision at such an early stage\nLast night, the first crack appeared in Yearn’s armour. Will their mistake make the community lose their faith, or can we all rally behind this giant of DeFi, and help them to grow even stronger?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Now they have lost another $10,000,000, and we find out that Value DeFi do not really know copy paste either, as they report the exploit was made possible due to losing a line of code by “human error”\nTen million dollars lost due to basic mistakes by the team, yet the native token $VALUE barely dumped at all.\n\n\nThe following analysis is taken from the official post-mortem.\nOn May 5th 2021, 3:22 AM UTC, the exploiter re-initialized the pool and set the operator role to himself and _stakeToken to HACKEDMONEY.\nBy doing so, the exploiter took control of the pool and called the method governanceRecoverUnsupported() and drained the original stake token (vBWAP/BUSD LP).\nThe exploiter then removed 10,839.16 vBWAP/BUSD LP, then burned the LP tokens and received 7342.75 vBSWAP and 205,659.22 BUSD.\nThe exploiter then sold all 7342.75 vBSWAP for 8790.77 BNB at 1inch.\nThe exploiter used both BNB and BUSD to buy renBTC and used renBridge to move the funds back to BTC, sent to the following address: 1Cm6WGvXQ9EgvvWX5dRsBxE2NvxFjfbcVF\nThe actions can be verified on-chain here.\nThe affected pool contract had an initialize() function that should have been activated after deployment.\nThe line: initialized = true; is missing from the function.\nThis meant anyone could re-initialize the pool and set themself as owner, thereby taking full control. As owner, the exploiter used the governanceRecoverUnsupported(), which is used for recovering pool funds in the event of a bug or undesired event.\nDuring set up of the profit-sharing vStake pool, the code was not written from scratch but migrated from the old implementation of the Value DeFi Reserve Fund, which had the correct setting. When merging the code, the line was not included.\n\nIn the end, the hacker was the only one who got their value for their money, a ten million dollar prize without even taking out a loan.\nThe Value DeFi team however, just got another spot on our leaderboard.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Franklin, Peckshield, LiFi, Jumper Exchange, Rivanorth\nFive days is all it took for history to repeat itself.\nOn July 11th, a new contract facet was added to the LiFi protocol.\nThis new contract contained a vulnerable function that lacked proper validation.\nAs Nick L. Franklin pointed out that the attack was due to a lack of validation in the \"swap\" function of the new contract facet added to the protocol.\nThe vulnerable contract failed to properly check the call target and call data, allowing an exploiter to perform a \"call injection\" attack.\nThis enabled the attacker to execute arbitrary functions using the permissions granted to the LiFi contract.\nBecause of this, users who approved the contract for infinite approvals lost their tokens.\nLiFi router set this implementation recently:\n\nAttacker's address:\n0x8B3Cb6Bf982798fba233Bca56749e22EEc42DcF3\nAffected contract addresses:\nEVM Chains: 0x1231deb6f5749ef6ce6943a275a1d3e7486f4eae\nzkSync: 0x341e94069f53234fE6DabeF707aD424830525715\nLinea: 0xDE1E598b81620773454588B85D6b5D4eEC32573e\nMetis: 0x24ca98fB6972F5eE05f0dB00595c7f68D9FaFd68\nFunds stolen include USDT, USDC, and DAI totalling approximately $9.73M, which were subsequently swapped for 2,857 ETH.\nThe stolen assets have been distributed to multiple wallets controlled by the attacker.\n\nAs the $3.3M Socket protocol hack on January 16th shows, cross-chain bridges and aggregators continue to be prime targets for blackhats.\nLet me know if this sounds familiar?\nThe Attacker targeted wallets that had granted infinite approvals to Socket contracts exploiting a recently added route to their bridging contract.\nPeckshield provided some further analysis on the hack and seen a direct parallel to the previous attack on LiFi:\n\nIn the post-mortem of the previous exploit, LiFi stated “We then implemented a whitelist to only allow calls to approved DEXs. Our contract was upgraded to include this new whitelist functionality, and swaps were reenabled. On top of that, we have disabled infinite approvals by default.”\nNo word on the most recent contract facet being audited.\nLooks like this fell between the cracks, proving once again that in DeFi, yesterday's patch is tomorrow's exploit.\nWith millions at stake, how many more \"infinite approvals\" will it take before users stop playing Russian roulette with their assets?\n\nInfinite approvals: The gift that keeps on grifting.\nDespite LiFi's response that only wallets affected were set to infinite approvals and represented only a very small number of users, the magnitude of the loss suggests otherwise.\nIt's hard to believe that so many users would be vulnerable if infinite approvals weren't commonplace.\nWith nearly $10M stolen, this will have been a costly lesson in approvals hygiene for many.\nWithout a regular revoking detox using a tool such as revoke.cash, token approvals sit waiting for a live (or forgotten) project to be exploited.\nHowever, all this could have simply been avoided by not making risky, unaudited upgrades to an existing protocol contract.\nInfinite approvals to upgradeable contracts should come with warnings by every wallet\nMaybe it's time to start questioning those \"infinite\" permissions.\nHave you checked your approvals lately?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

DeFi plot lines are rarely straightforward. Anonymity and composability are the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy; there are multiple ways one can profit from a single incident, meaning smart players don’t always take the most obvious reward.\n$9.4m taken, $3.2m recovered and $6.2m lost.\nCOVER (formerly known as SAFE) fell ~90% when an infinite mint loophole was uncovered and exploited, causing the total supply of tokens to increase by 48 quadrillion percent, from 84,477 to 40,796,131,214,802,600,000.\nSix different addresses minted COVER via this loophole before it was closed. Some kept the money, others did not.\nOf the six addresses to use the loophole, the previously unknownGrap Finance gained the most attention, as they took the opportunity to present themselves as a “White hat” by selling minted COVER for ETH and returning it with a sassy message.\nCode is law, but loopholes remain - we can rely on attackers to take advantage, but we know things are rarely as simple as they seem.\nWho had cover on their $COVER? We went undercover to find out.\n\nRekt OPSEC\nThe original attack had four steps and one attacker, but the story became more complicated once the loophole was made public, and other wallets replicated the process.\nThe following timelines are taken from the official Cover Post-Mortem, for a more detailed analysis, please see the step by step from @vasa_dev.\nTimeline for Exploiter 1\nDec-28–2020 04:09:27 AM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 08:08:12 AM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 at 08:11:16 AM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 08:47:15 AM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 09:18:28 AM +UTC\nIn total, Exploiter 1 stole around $4.4 million of user funds and transferred it to this address.\nIt seems the loophole was discovered accidentally at first, as exploiter 1 had poor OPSEC, a normal wallet funded by an exchange with KYC, trading for 3 years. Some claim to know the identity of this exploiter, and suggest that they return the funds.\nIn a classic DeFi plot twist, the original attacker attracted little attention compared to Grap Finance, who seized the opportunity to play the role of “White Hat”.\nTimeline for Grap Finance\nDec-28–2020 11:54:47 AM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 11:58:04 AM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 11:58:56 AM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 12:00:21 PM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 12:02:04 PM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 12:29:03 PM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 12:59:27 PM +UTC\nDec-28–2020 at 01:41:01 PM +UTC\nCoverage from Cover\n\nIt took six hours for Cover Protocol to publicly acknowledge the attack.\nThe team is still investigating the current incident. The exploit is no longer possible.\nPlease do NOT buy $COVER tokens, and remove your liquidity from the COVER/ETH pool on sushiswap.\nCLAIM/NOCLAIM balancer pools are unaffected\nEight hours after the attack, Cover protocol announced their plan to refund affected users.\nHello everyone, we are exploring providing a NEW $COVER token through a snapshot before the minting exploit was abused. The 4350 ETH that has been returned by the attacker will also be handled through a snapshot to the LP token holders.We are still investigating. Do NOT buy COVER\n“What is dead may never die” appears never more true than in DeFi. A fourth iteration of the Cover Protocol token will be issued to refund the affected users.\nSAFE - SAFE2 - COVER - $RECOVER?\nPersistence is admirable up to a certain extent, but when is enough enough?\nSome readers will remember the full history of Cover Protocol, who rebranded from SAFE after both @azeemfi and @chefcoverage made poor decisions. They then launched SAFE2, which was migrated to the COVER which we know today.\nIs the community is willing to give them a FOURTH opportunity?\n\nGrap Finance is a fork of YAM - who having failed to ship anything noteworthy during DeFi summer, jumped at the opportunity to gain attention by presenting themselves as a White Hat, which gained them thousands of followers in just one day.\nWhat they will do with this new found following remains to be seen.\nGrap Finance’s unusual activity puts them within the top five balance changes for COVER within the last 7 days.\n\nThey say there’s no such thing as bad publicity, and this seems to be confirmed by the next chart - unique addresses for COVER increased on the day of the attack by 1,778, as opportunist traders tried to catch a falling knife.\n\nHere we see Binance shown in green, a huge increase in COVER deposits as the community tried to jump ship before they eventually paused trading for the token.\n\nResponsible behaviour may not offer much reward, but wages of sin are always paid in full.\nSome say this was an insider job gone wrong.\nPerhaps the attackers got doxxed, couldn’t keep the funds, so sent them back and profited from promo instead.\n\nWe don’t claim that these rumours are based in fact, but it’s easy to see how such ideas arise when the day's events lead to announcements such as this.\n\nPure coincidence is out of the question, this is foul play or desperation. MXC must have fallen on hard times if they’re listing tokens based on gossip.\nCrypto Twitter has proven that their risk appetite remains strong by pumping the price of their “rescuers” token by several thousand percent, increasing its 24hr trading volume from $236 to $5,458,084 at the time of writing.\nEmiliano Bonassi provided the following quote:\nSetting a side the technical issue, this event showed again how this ecosystem is cohesive and supportive.\nWe are antifragile.\nI am pretty sure that after this event not only a new Cover will emerge but more importantly a collective to guarantee safety and prompt reaction in the ecosystem - maybe The WhiteHack Group\nBlood is a big expense. The DeFi insurance market is in a sorry state.\nFirst NXM and now Cover. It doesn’t matter if the protocol is unaffected, if we have to write an article about you, then the user's confidence in your project has already gone.\nDeFi insurance must be fully comprehensive. Acts of god don’t happen here.\nInsecure protocols pay high premiums, while others work hard to build their no claims bonus.\nCOVER went down 40x in 4 hours while $GRAP went up 40x.\n“No gains” say Grap team from behind their screen, a tall tale that tells half the truth.\nBlack hats painted white don’t last under a shower of allegations.\nThe investigation continues...\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The v3 insurance fund remains well funded with $13.5m in funds remaining\nNo user funds were affected and our team is working to investigate the event\nThe incident was characterised as an attack by founder Antonio Juliano shortly after. A follow-up tweet elaborated on what had gone on behind the scenes:\nin the part few days $YFI open interest on dYdX spiked from $0.8m -> $67m\nbasically all of this was driven one actor (traceable through on chain fund movements)\nthis same actor attempted unsuccessfully to attack the dYdX $SUSHI market 2 weeks ago in a similar way\n$YFI OI was higher on dYdX than any other perp venue\n...\nthe $YFI price crash in the spot market seems like an intentional effort by a single actor (unsure whether the same or different one) to target the large OI on dYdX. We are still in communication with CEXs to confirm their understanding of this\nThis information strongly makes me think this was an intentional market manipulation attempt by a well capitalized actor(s) designed to drain funds from the dYdX insurance pool\nThe team appears to be confident that they’ll track down whoever is responsible, though, offering bounties to anyone who can provide info, but refusing to negotiate with the exploiter themself.\nMaybe the way things worked out for Avi has given dYdX a confidence boost?\n\nIn response to the attack, dYdX have added extra margin requirements for lower liquidity tokens.\nHowever, the responses have provoked criticism for perceived hypocrisy and skirting decentralised decision-making.\nNot to worry, though, negative feedback “doesn’t matter”.\nWhile DEX code may be a case of set-and-forget, margin and lending protocols need constant tweaking in response to market conditions, and dYdX’s coming pivot to a standalone chain is set to feature full decentralisation.\nGovernance may have its own flaws (and weaknesses), but decisions made behind closed doors usually don’t sit well with the community.\nHowever, when everyone gets their own say on risk management…\n…who’s to blame when things go wrong?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The other assets were not swapped due to the whitehat intercepting them.\nThe hacker’s plan only paid off for one of the three pools however, as the owner of a frontrunning bot decided to put on their white hat upon noticing the transactions.\nThe saviour made their motives clear via tx input data, and negotiations began via email.\n\nOriginal attack tx:0x7604c7dd6e9bcdba8bac277f1f8e7c1e4c6bb57afd4ddf6a16f629e8495a0281\nWhitehat frontrun tx: 0x597d11c05563611cb4ad4ed4c57ca53bbe3b7d3fefc37d1ef0724ad58904742b\nHowever, the whitehat didn’t manage to stop all the funds from reaching the attacker:\nUnfortunately, it looks like my frontrun was not perfect, as I did end up sending $3M USDC to the original hacker. Rewriting txs can be tricky.\nFollowing a brief exchange between the two, the Punk team managed to convince the whitehat that the incident had not been an inside job.\nA bounty of $1M was decided by the protocol’s anonymous ally and after a halfhearted attempt to negotiate, the team eventually agreed, and the remaining ~$5M was returned.\nApprox $1.95M DAI: 0x008dd92f8bcfcee400aed26d13495fbfc8351f9b21289792fc2bb9e771668147\nApprox $3M USDT: 0xace7c07695ec1bbf917486c3c81ee7de79c04e0309d4f6a149688463e6f83247\nPunk Protocol states that all recovered funds will go towards compensation efforts for their users, and that they will release an update within the next few days.\nThe Punk team is also still hoping for a change of heart from their attacker, although any amount of refund made would be insignificant compared to the previous day's events at Poly Network.\n\nIs a white hat white if they refuse to return part of the money they save?\nAlthough the anonymous actor only kept 16% of what was stolen, it was still worth $1M when they forced the deal onto Punk Protocol.\nSomething is better than nothing, and the Punk team have little reason to be angry at the whitehat, but that money could have gone back to its original owners...\nAnti-heroes are everywhere in DeFi. It's white hat by day, and black by night.\nSecurity auditor salaries are nothing compared to what they can earn by using their skills for themselves, and they're given the first and best opportunity to do so.\nWhitehats set their own wages, while security auditors take their salaries and the blame.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

In doing so, the team introduced a vulnerability leading to an astonishingly simple exploit.\nThe new code left the burn() function publicly callable, allowing anyone to burn SFM tokens from any address.\n\nThis allowed the attacker to burn large quantities of SFM held inside the SFM:BNB liquidity pool, vastly inflating the price of SFM tokens in the pool.\n\nThen, by selling (previously acquired) SFM tokens into the skewed pool, the attacker was able to drain it of BNB liquidity, for a profit of 28k BNB, or $8.9M.\nExploit tx: 0x48e52a12…\nAttacker’s address: 0x286e09932b8d096cba3423d12965042736b8f850\nThe hacker claims to have frontrunned attack and has reached out to Safemoon to negotiate the return of funds, the majority of which have since been transferred to 0x237D where they remain at the time of writing.\n\nSince its launch two years ago, Safemoon has been beset by scandal.\nInitially labelled as a pump and dump scheme, Safemoon shillfluencers were later slapped with a class action suit, before Coffeezilla published a series of detailed investigations into what went on behind the scenes.\nThe favourite of tiktok investors during the peak of Spring 2021’s BSC hype, Safemoon claimed it was un-ruggable due to locked liquidity, which was topped-up with every transfer of tokens. However, the transfer fees were also criticised as ponzinomics as bagholders were disincentivised to sell.\nAt the peak of shitcoin szn, we wrote:\nthe shitcoins show no sign of stopping\nThe markets have cooled down significantly since then, and it seems hardly believable that some of these projects have managed to survive this far….\nGiven the vulnerability was introduced by the project’s deployer address, Peckshield (perhaps charitably, or perhaps via Hanlon’s Razor) suggested that admin keys may have been leaked or phished.\nRegardless of whether the funds are in the hands of a blackhat hacker or whitehat MEV frontrunner, the lack of trust in Safemoon from the wider crypto community suggests they’ll unlikely be safe, even with the team…\nWhether a botched rug attempt, or sheer incompetence, this episode is not a good look for a project that was never very highly regarded.\nDespite all the bad press, any remaining soldiers in the SFM army appear to still believe, or are suffering from a bagholder’s case of Stockholm Syndrome.\nPerhaps if they haven’t been put off by now, they never will be.\nAnd even if this turns out to be a lucky escape for Safemoon, errors like this don’t bode well for the project’s future.\nHow much longer can Safemoon last?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Trusting SpookySwap V2/V3 pool prices for their BOO token oracle - about as secure as using a paper lock on a bank vault.\nBy draining the BOO token reserves through a flash loan, the attacker manipulated the price feed like a puppeteer with particularly profitable strings.\nOne BOO deposit was all it took to borrow against artificially inflated collateral, proving that in DeFi, sometimes the simplest tricks are the most expensive.\nExploiter:\n0x511f427Cdf0c4e463655856db382E05D79Ac44a6\nExploiter contract:\n0xA21451aC32372C123191B3a4FC01deB69F91533a\nFlow of Funds on Metasleuth.\nThe team's post-exploit performance deserves its own review.\nHours after watching roughly $8.7 million evaporate, they filed a police report claiming $12 million in losses - perhaps hoping inflation would make up the difference.\nThe team's crisis management playbook rolled out with clockwork predictability.\nWithin hours, they'd paused the platform, notified bridges, and claimed to have traced the exploiter's wallet to Binance - though blockchain analysis suggests the funds had already begun their journey through different paths.\n\"Platform paused soon after the exploit was identified. Bridges were notified. We identified wallets involved and traced it to Binance,\" announced the Polter team, punctuating their statement with the DeFi equivalent of \"thoughts and prayers\" - a promise to contact authorities.\nLike a jilted lover sliding into DMs, Polter took to the blockchain to negotiate - though perhaps their time would've been better spent sliding into auditors' inboxes months ago.\nIn the grand tradition of \"move fast and break things,\" Polter Finance skipped the tedious business of security audits entirely. Their confidence in unaudited code proved almost as inflated as their BOO token prices.\n\"As the smart contract used is identical to Geist, except for the removal of the flash-loan function in Lending Pool, we are providing the Geist audit report here\" - proclaims Polter's audit page, demonstrating the kind of security theater that gives Broadway a run for its money.\nThe aftermath serves as yet another case study in the false economy of skipping audits. Close to $8.7 million lost to save what - a few weeks and a few thousand dollars?\nBut who needs professional security reviews when you can CTRL+C CTRL+V your way to launch?\nThe only audit they got was from the exploiter - and those results just came in.\nCrypto may be rocketing into the mainstream, but unless protocols like Polter start getting their act together, it’s more likely to crash and burn before it ever reaches the moon.\nThe industry's growing pains are already painful enough, and without addressing these basic security flaws, mainstream adoption could end up being a full-speed disaster.\nAnyone else think Polter won’t stick around for the full ride?\n\nAnother day, another protocol proving that copying code doesn't equal competence.\nPolter Finance's roughly $8.7 million lesson in basic oracle security came with extra credit in creative accounting - their $12 million police report suggesting they're better at inflating numbers than securing them.\nFrom skipping audits to serving up manipulatable oracles on a silver platter, the team demonstrated a masterclass in \"how not to run a DeFi protocol.\"\nTheir security strategy amounted to little more than hopes, prayers, and someone else's audit report.\nThe exploiter didn't discover a novel vulnerability - they simply walked through the front door Polter left wide open.\nIn crypto's current surge toward mainstream adoption, such amateur-hour security practices aren't just embarrassing - they're dangerous.\nPolter now takes its place among the countless protocols that mistook convenience for competence.\nBut here's the real haunting question - how many more users need to get rekt before protocols realize that copy pasta code doesn't make you ready for primetime?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

In the time before the vulnerability was patched, the hacker left plenty of ETH, USDC and DAI untouched, presumably because the attacker had “had enough”.\nHow did it happen?\n\nAttacker’s address: 0x1574f7f4c9d3aca2ebce918e5d19d18ae853c090\nExploit tx: 0xdee86cae2e1bab16496a49…\nAssets taken:\n19.4M QI (pre-hack value of $24M) sold in four transactions for a total of 2.3k WETH (~$6.2M)\n24.4 WETH - (~$76k)\n563k USDC sold for 173 WETH\n45k SDT - sold for ~17 WETH - (~$54k)\n24k STACK - sold for ~6.2 WETH - (~$19k)\n39k sdam3CRV - Swapped to am3CRV, then to ~44k amDAI\n1.5M MOCA - 1M of 1.5M sold for 173 WETH (~$500K)\n11k MATIC - Not yet sold\nTotal - ~$8.7M\n~6 hours after the attack, Superfluid patched the bug with help from Mudit Gupta.\nThe patch can be found here.\nThe text below is taken from Superfluid’s own post-mortem.\nVulnerability Explanation\nSuperfluid.sol, known as the host contract, is the contract that allows composable Superfluid agreements (ConstantFlowAgreement, InstantDistributionAgreement) in one single transaction, and the composed systems are often called Super Apps.\nHowever, in order to have a trusted and shared state through the entire transaction between different agreement calls, a concept called “ctx” (a serialized state managed by the host contract) is introduced.\nThe “ctx” contains all the context an agreement function needs to know, that includes especially who is the “msg.sender” of the initial call.\nThat’s where an unfortunate vulnerability was exploited.\nThe attacker was able to skillfully craft the calldata such that the process of serialization in the host contract and succeeding de-serialization in the agreement contract resulted in the agreement contract operating on a context object forged specifically to impersonate other accounts.\nThis mechanism was used in order to create IDA indexes “on behalf” of other accounts and move out their tokens that way.\nThe Exploiter Contract:\nThe following exploiter contract demonstrates how the vulnerability could be used to impersonate other accounts to close their open streams.\nIn the actual exploit transaction, the attacker used the IDA contract to drain funds from other accounts using the same technique:\n\nChain of Function Calls\ndeleteAnyFlowBad\nThe convention to callAgreement is to use the placeholder ctx, so that later agreement solidity code can read it directly as an argument “ctx”.\nTo read more about this concept, see About-Placeholder-Ctx.\nThis is where the attacker managed to inject a faked “ctx”, where an arbitrary sender could be set.\nSuperfluid.callAgreement\nIn the normal case, Superfluid.callAgreement creates the ctx and puts a stamp on it (stores its hash in a state variable), such that it can be validated using Superfluid.isCtxValid.\nConstantFlowAgreementV1.createFlow\n\nThe agreement then uses AgreementLibrary.authorizeTokenAccess to verify that the calling host contract is authorized to do state modifying calls on the token contract.\nAgreementLibrary.authorizeTokenAccess\nOnce the calling host is authenticated, the agreement would transitively also trust the handed over ctx and decode (de-serialize) it into a memory structure.\n\nBut Fake Ctx!\nThe problem was that as in the exploiting function deleteAnyFlowBad, one can inject a fake ctx.\nAfter being merged into one bytes object by Superfluid.replacePlaceholderCtx (the Host doesn’t make any assumptions about agreement specific data), the resulting dataWithCtx now contains 2 ctx variants, the legitimate one and the injected one.\nWhen the agreement contract decodes this data, the abi decoder takes the first (injected) variant and ignores the remaining data which contains the legitimate ctx.\nIn order to solve this, Superfluid added a verification step in the agreement contract:\nISuperfluid.isCtxValid. This verifies the decoded ctx by comparing its stamp (hash) stored in the host contract.\nThis check was already in place for handling ctx data provided by SuperApp callbacks, but was not in place for data handed over by the trusted Host contract.\n\nSuperfluid has reached out to the attacker on-chain and, according to the post-mortem, a $1M bounty remains on the table in exchange for the return of the funds.\nThe team also states that most of the affected accounts have already been refunded, while the larger QI and MOCA losses will be compensated more gradually.\nAlthough this was not the largest exploit (number 42 on our leaderboard), and no user funds were lost, it is notable for the manner in which it affected other protocols.\nThe growing area of DAO infrastructure presents more targets for the anonymous attackers who are so prevalent in DeFi.\nThe stolen money still sits in the attackers wallet.\nWill they take the bounty, or leave Superfluid high and dry?\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

However, just 10 days after launch, the new mechanism was attacked, depegging USP and leaving it heavily undercollateralised.\nThe Platypus team announced the attack:\nDear Community,\nWe regret to inform you that our protocol was hacked recently, and the attacker took advantage of a flaw in our USP solvency check mechanism. They used a flashloan to exploit a logic error in the USP solvency check mechanism in the contract holding the collateral.\nAccording to a recent announcement on the launch, USP “provides an extra layer of protection from the volatility that other stablecoins may experience”.\nA statement worthy of a Darwin award?\n\nCredit: Daniel Von Fange, Peckshield\nThe exploit took advantage of a faulty check mechanism when withdrawing collateral.\nThe attacker first took a flash loan of 44M USDC which was deposited into Platypus. The resulting LP tokens were then used as collateral to borrow 41.7M USP.\nThe emergencyWithdraw() function only checks whether the user’s position is currently solvent, but neglects to first check against any the effect of any borrowed funds. This allows the attacker to withdraw the supplied collateral while keeping the borrowed USP.\n\nThe collateral was then withdrawn to repay the flash loan, and the USP was swapped via Platypus pools, draining the existing liquidity of other stables (USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, etc.).\nAttacker’s address: 0xeff003d64046a6f521ba31f39405cb720e953958\nAttack tx: 0x1266a937…\nAttack contract: 0x67afdd6489d40a01dae65f709367e1b1d18a5322/\nThe hack has left USP depegged by over 50% as the attacker swapped the USP for other stables. The stolen $8.5M remain in the hacker’s contract, of which, $1.5M of stolen USDT has been blacklisted.\nThe rather simple vulnerability, combined with the loot being left (or possibly trapped) as freezable, centralised stables suggests this heist may have been pulled off by a relatively inexperienced amateur.\nWhy not swap to a less controlled asset? Or bridge the funds and send them to Tornado?\n\nAs it turns out, OPSEC is not this hacker’s strong suit.\nAfter just a few hours, fellow platypus ZachXBT managed to identify the culprit via their ENS address, linked to the exploiter’s transaction history. The same alias was used for now-deleted Twitter and Instagram accounts. The Platypus team have since appealed to the doxxed exploiter:\nWe're in the process of setting up a bounty & encourage the hacker to reach out to us. We also welcome anyone with useful information to come forward to us.\nSafety in numbers…\nJust like the Platypus itself, DeFi is a strange and unique beast.\nA hybrid species born of cypherpunk hackers and finance bros, every protocol must speedrun their way through natural selection.\nIt’s a jungle out there…\n…and, as ever, it’s survival of the fittest.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

It's just the owners of some validators, subnets and miners that were drained.\nReady to unpack this clusterbleep of cosmic proportions?\n\nCredit: Bittensor, ZachXBT\nBittensor initially announced in their Discord that a number of their wallets were attacked, going on to state that they’re investigating and have halted all on-chain transactions as a precaution.\nThe attack on Bittensor's blockchain unfolded with the precision of a well-practiced qigong routine.\nOver a mere 3-hour span, the attacker managed to compromise multiple high-value wallets, making off with approximately 32,000 TAO tokens.\nAs the Bittensor team scrambled to respond, the crypto community's favorite on-chain sleuth was already on the case.\nShortly after the theft, ZachXBT identified the address that stole the funds:\n5FbWTraF7jfBe5EvCmSThum85htcrEsCzwuFjG3PukTUQYot\nZach, ever the crypto detective, may have tied it to a previous incident on June 1st, where a TAO holder had over 28k TAO stolen, worth $11.2M at the time of the theft.\nThe day after the attack, the Opentensor Foundation (OTF) dropped their post-mortem, revealing the root cause of the attack was a compromised PyPi Package Manager.\nHere's how this digital dumpster fire unfolded:\nA malicious package, masquerading as a legitimate Bittensor package, snuck its way into PyPi version 6.12.2.\nThis trojan horse contained code designed to steal unencrypted coldkey details.\nWhen unsuspecting users downloaded this package and decrypted their coldkeys, the decrypted bytecode was sent to a remote server controlled by the attacker.\nThe vulnerability affected users who downloaded the Bittensor PyPi package between May 22 and May 29, or used Bittensor==6.12.2, and then performed certain operations like staking, unstaking, transferring, delegating, or undelegating.\nIn response to the attack, the Bittensor team quickly put the chain into \"safe mode”, halting all transactions while continuing to produce blocks.\nThis swift action may have prevented further losses, but it also highlighted the centralized control the team maintains over the supposedly decentralized network.\nThe OTF has taken immediate steps to mitigate the damage:\nRemoved the malicious 6.12.2 package from the PyPi Package Manager repository.\nConducted a thorough review of Subtensor and Bittensor code on Github.\nWorked with exchanges to trace the attacker and potentially salvage funds.\nMoving forward, the OTF has promised enhanced package verification, increased outside audit frequency, improved security standards, and increased monitoring moving forward.\nThe OTF stated that the incident did not affect the blockchain or Subtensor code, and the underlying Bittensor protocol remains uncompromised and secure.\nThey have also been working with several exchanges, providing them with details of the attack in order to trace the attacker and potentially salvage funds.\nAs the dust settles, the community is left pondering how the malicious package slipped through PyPi's defenses and whether this attack is linked to the June 1st theft.\nIt seems in the world of Bittensor, the path to enlightenment is paved with some empty wallets.\n\nThe Bittensor hack exposes a critical vulnerability in the crypto ecosystem, the reliance on third-party package managers.\nWhile blockchain protocols themselves may be secure, the tools developers use to interact with them can become unexpected points of failure.\nThis incident raises questions about the security practices of PyPi and other package repositories that the crypto community depends on.\nThe timing and similarity to the June 1st theft can't be ignored.\nAre these isolated incidents, or is there a more widespread campaign targeting Bittensor and similar projects?\nAs the OTF works with exchanges to trace the stolen funds, the community watches with bated breath, hoping for a recovery that rarely comes in the wake of such hacks.\nBittensor's swift action in halting the network demonstrates the double-edged nature of centralized control in \"decentralized\" projects.\nWhile it may have prevented further losses, it also highlights the fragility of the system.\nIn the Tao of crypto, the only constant is change and occasionally, an $8 million vanishing act.\nAs Bittensor reflects on its security practices, will they find true blockchain enlightenment or are they destined to keep laying down these expensive stepping stones on the path to a more perfect protocol?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

In just 24 hours we hear of two more attacks.\nCheese Bank - $3.3m via flashloan AMM oracle attack, Origin Protocol, $8m via flash loan and faketoken re-entrancy\nIn the last 30 days, we’ve seen over $45 million of users funds removed from unsecure protocols. In addition to the most recent attacks, we’ve seen Harvest ($25M) > Value DeFi ($7M)> and Akropolis (~$2M)\nIn epidemiology, the basic reproduction number, or “R number” is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.\nIn cryptocurrency, the R number is the quantity of protocols that are currently getting totally REKT by flash loans and fake tokens.\nWe’re seeing the R number increase day by day as the publicity of each attack serves as duplication instructions for the next capable coder who’s willing to take risks.\nAlthough each hack attracts attention and even some compliments on their expertise, we should remember not to glorify this behaviour.\nAny “Robin Hood” comparison is way off the mark here. Hackers are stealing money from those who have less.\nAlthough, we are learning from the experience.\nWe can hold the opinion that flash loans are good for the space without promoting greed and theft.\nHaving said that, greed is not without its benefits.\nWould banks be secure if there were no robbers?\nGreed is at the core of our capitalist system, yet it brings us vaccines...\nIf, as some say, the hackers are acting simply to expose weak code and educate the space, perhaps it would be best to eventually return all funds, rather than rely on their personal judgement to decide who should be refunded.\nHowever, perhaps there is also some greed in the behaviour of the developers, who could wait and have their code thoroughly audited pre-launch instead of gambling with users funds.\nOn the other hand, if there was no predatory risk to shit code, then the developer would become the apex predator, and the cycle would continue.\nAll parties involved in these attacks have some degree of responsibility. The amount of responsibility varies, yet the motivation is identical.\nGreed is human nature, and it's a key concept in the game of DeFi.\nEach actor involved in these unfortunate events presents their greed through different actions.\nThe Ape - Hopes to make a profit and bet on the untested code. Greed shows through their impatience, yet the early bird has been rewarded well in the past, so their desired outcome is not without precedence.\nThe Dev - Expecting to profit the most from their newly released code, the greedy dev is blinded by their expectations, and skips the essential safety audit as they rush their code to market.\nThe Hacker - The apex predator is not immune, but is able to use superior knowledge to weaponise his greed while others are handicapped by it. If you had worked to acquire knowledge that enabled you to take money in this way, would you return millions of dollars?\nWhile there is no cure for greed, we should remember that it can create things which are positive, and that there are steps we can take to protect ourselves from its negative consequences.\nAudits are not cheap, but they’re a small price to pay compared to losing funds or your reputation to a hack or exploit.\n\nDeFi winter is here, and there probably will be more casualties in the coming months.\nAlthough immunity is never 100% guaranteed, we can take steps to reduce the likelihood of infection.\nThe R number changes according to our behaviour, developers must put protocols into lockdown immediately.\nThis is an epidemic that affects only the weak. Once infected, there is no cure.\nThe only protection is in prevention, code needs to be audited thoroughly if it is to survive the winter.\nAudit your code, wash your hands, don’t get rekt.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Sounds eerily similar to disgraced SBF’s now bankrupt exchange, doesn’t it?\nSun claimed (somewhat implausibly) not to have noticed the similarity, after CZ wasted no time in poking fun at the irony.\nWhat do they say about people in glass houses again?\nFirst FTX, then 3AC’s GTX, now HTX…\nDo we really have to get to ZTX before we hit the bottom?\n\nAs often is the case with hacks of centralised exchanges, details of the attack vector are scant.\nThe 4999 ETH ($7.9M) was drained at 10AM UTC on Sunday, with the remaining 633 ETH (worth $1M) secured by HTX just over two hours later.\nAttacker addresses:\n0xdb1D74467c9042517A354304256E0d658D8AEC83\n0x799982b75Ba538F211871cBa50Fa1A42ADa9ab5E\nIt seems strange that all funds were not drained, and that, if HTX were immediately aware of the incident (as Sun claims), that the rescue of the leftovers took so long.\nSun also says that the hacker has been identified (why not prove it?) and has extended an offer on-chain of 5% bounty, and a job, valid for seven days after which law enforcement will be informed.\nDespite the initial downplaying, Sun followed up with a thread announcing livestreams to talk exchange security. The thread also states:\nwe have implemented real-time monitoring mechanisms to prevent such losses.\nYou’d have thought an exchange holding $3B in user assets (as Sun claims) would already have this kind of system in place, right?\nBut given that Sun tends to use Huobi to YOLO mind-boggling sums of crypto around on a daily basis (presumably part of his duties as some kind of self-proclaimed crypto superhero), such a system might have set off alarm bells a little too often.\n\nThere appears to be a sudden wave of bad news coming out of the asian crypto markets recently.\nYesterday Mixin topped the 2023 leaderboard. Before that, another HK exchange, JPEX, abandoned ship following a warning from the regulators, and Upbit fell for a fake token top-up scam.\nTo top it off, Tether is dismissing rumours of trouble in Singapore as FUD, but someone looks to be trying to get rid of USDT.\nWill this $7.9M drop in the ocean turn out to be a simple case of ‘4’ for Huobi?\nOr are there bigger things to come?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

If two or more transactions contain a repeated k value, then the private key can be back-calculated.\nThis potential security flaw has been known since 2010, when console hacking group fail0verflow detailed the process here (p123-129). And its application to blockchain keys was later detailed in 2013.\nCredit: Tayvano\nDespite this, Anyswap’s post-mortem states that the attacker detected a repeated k value in two of the V3 Router’s transactions on BSC, and was able to back-calculate the private key.\nAnyswap stressed that “only the new V3 cross-chain liquidity pools have been affected” and that the bridge remains operational via V1 and V2 Routers. The post-mortem also states that the V3’s code has been fixed and will reopen after the 48hr timelock installed by the team expires.\nThe team has also reached out to potential bug bounty hunters:\nAnyswap will reward anyone who reports bugs to us. This will help us build truly secure and even better cross-chain solutions.\n\nThe need for fully secure bridges grows stronger by the day, as crypto capital spreads across multiple chains.\nHowever, the security architecture for cross-chain bridges is complex - proposing a puzzle to developers which has yet to be solved.\nAnyswap V3 was a prototype, so perfection was not expected, but considering the nature of the exploit, it seems this loss was preventable.\nAlthough action was taken relatively quickly to prevent another attack, @nicksdjohnson is of the opinion that the patch does not do enough.\nSetting aside the fact that there's a much better, industry standard solution to this, their patch:\nFails catastrophically (exposing users to another hack) if you accidentally delete a file, or restore from an old backup, or move to a new server.\nAnd it requires every signature request to scan every previous one, but really that's the smallest problem here.\nAnyswap call themselves a “trustless protocol”, but perhaps that label no longer has the desired effect after such a damning evaluation from a leading Ethereum developer.\nDo you trust the Anyswap patch?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Of these, MIM and FRAX are currently impacted.\nWe would like to request that owners of the accounts that did so consider returning the assets borrowed so that other users are able to access their liquidity. 1 acc. holder has already done so and we are willing to pay further bounties to the remaining 3 for doing the same.\nWe spoke to the founder of Hundred Finance, vfat:\nrekt:\nWill Hundred Finance be making any changes following this incident? You mention you are working with Meter towards a possible resolution - could you provide any more details?\nvfat:\nHello, so yes of course this is an issue we are all too aware of, each new chain / bridge we add has its own risks, and a lending protocol is a natural target for bridge attackers.\nWe used Meter as they were the main source of wrapped BTC on Moonriver, this combined with the native bridge and Multichain puts us at 3 bridges on that chain which is the maximum we would use. Going forward we will be stricter on this, and publish more detailed information about which bridges are used for which assets. We will also look into extra monitoring for possible attacks like this.\nMeter have of course accepted responsibility for this hack and are intending to use their native token for reimbursement to the extent that they can, currently we are in the gathering addresses and amounts stage.\nOne interesting thing is that there were 4 opportunistic loans at Hundred in total, but the first 2 have been repaid, so there is some modicum of hope still for the other 2.\nCurrent loss to Hundred users is $3.3M.\n\nThe voluntary repayments of the “opportunistic loans” taken on Hundred Finance are a rare sight to see, and it is commendable that Meter are accepting full responsibility for all losses.\nMeter claim to have some evidence as to the identity of the hacker, and have stated they are working with authorities to bring justice.\nHowever, on-chain crime rarely has off-chain consequences, and it won’t be long until we see another attack of this type.\nThere will be more bridge attacks, and more users will lose money, but eventually someone will succeed in building a safe bridge.\nWe are still too early to be risk-free, but that just means more opportunity.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

But when these digital soothsayers falter, chaos ensues.\nAccording to DeFiLlama, Rho Markets is a fork of Compound Finance and held approximately $38 million worth of assets shortly before the exploit.\nCompound itself was at the heart of last week’s panic over the wave of front-end hijacking incidents on popular DeFi platforms.\nRho Market's oracle misconfiguration allowed an MEV bot to manipulate price data, creating an arbitrage opportunity that drained $7.5 million from the protocol in a matter of minutes.\nFirst reported by CJ the “Doughnut”, who noted that the platform was drained of USDC and USDT.\nCJ linked to the possible attacker’s address, which showed a gain of $7.5 million over the past hours.\nRho Markets acknowledged the unusual behavior and paused the platform.\nThe incident prompted Scroll, the L2 network hosting RhoMarket, to temporarily halt the chain.\nZachXBT highlighted that “Exploiter has a ton of exposure to centralized exchanges so would say there’s a good probability this gets recovered and they are gray or white hat.”\nZach was not too far from the mark, as he shared an on chain message shortly after:\n“Hello RHO team, our MEV bot have profited from your price oracle misconfiguration. We understand that the funds belong to users and are willing to fully return. But first we would like you to admit that it was not an exploit or a hack, but a misconfiguration on your end. Also, please provide what are you going to do to prevent it from happening again?”\nThey honored their word and the funds were returned shortly after.\nRho Markets confirmed that the issue was resolved, without any loss of funds and they are currently reassigning funds back to the borrow pools.\nIn response to the recent events, Rho Markets has outlined the following three-step plan:\nIdentify accounts that supplied funds during the oracle malfunction.\nReplenish the USDC, USDT, and wstETH pools to restore affected balances.\nReinstate borrowing and transfer functionalities while adhering to strict security protocols.\nWhile a prior security audit had identified potential vulnerabilities in the protocol's oracle implementation, the incident stemmed from a human error during deployment rather than a code flaw.\nIn a space where censorship-resistance and permissionless are more than just buzzwords, incidents like these force us to confront uncomfortable truths about the current state of blockchain infrastructure.\nWhile Rho Market dodged a bullet this time thanks to a benevolent bot operator, will the next white hat be so generous?\n\nThe recent DeFi debacle not only exposed oracle misconfiguration issues but also reignited the debate on decentralization in Layer 2 solutions.\nAs Rho Market's blunder prompted Scroll to halt its chain, Sudo pointed out that L2s touting permissionless and censorship-resistant values are merely posturing to attract VC money, making L1 Ethereum's genuine decentralization all the more appealing.\nL2 operators now face a catch-22, censor to save funds and risk centralization accusations or stay true to permissionless ideals at the users' expense.\nWith centralized sequencers and provers becoming common on L2s, liability concerns grow as operators potentially become centralized failure points vulnerable to legal and regulatory pressure.\nWhile Layer 2 solutions promise scalability and decentralization.\nAre we building a censorship-resistant future or just creating a more efficient version of the systems we aimed to replace?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Beosin also provided a summary table.\n\nThe mixed messaging around the incident was bound to lead to some slight errors in reporting.\nHowever, given the $100M+ in liquidations caused by Cointelegraph’s unsourced Bitcoin ETF announcement on Monday, you’d have thought they would be being tweeting extra carefully.\nApparently not.\nFor a website that holds itself to “high journalistic standards”, blaming the social media team (as well as “the society” and “the technology” at large) should probably be followed up by fact-checking tweets…\n…at least for a couple of days…\n…and against the article it refers to.\nBad luck seems to haunt the Fantom ecosystem like a spectre.\nCronje may have boasted of the Foundation’s treasury holdings last year, presumably to bolster confidence in the ecosystem in the wake of the uncertainty which followed FTX’s blowup.\nBut, assuming the funds (which apparently include over $100M in stables) are still there, the Foundation now holds far more than the chain’s entire TVL, which has been gradually bleeding from over $500M earlier this year, to just $40M today.\n\nA general downtrend was punctuated in July by the Multichain debacle.\nNow, whether for good reason or not, yesterday’s news has spooked users once more.\nIs FTM cursed?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

We will update when there is more information to it.\nBut, then again, Hundred have been through all this before.\nLast February, Hundred caught a stray to the tune of 3.3M when Meter got rekt.\nThe following month saw Hundred’s leaderboard debut, when $6.2M was lost on xDAI chain to a dual-edged attack which also hit Agave DAO for $5.5M.\nThat time, the attack vector was the same reentrancy mechanism which hit CREAM Finance in August 2021.\nWith Hundred’s leaderboard total now standing at $16.9M…\n…what was it this time?\n\nCredit: Daniel Von Fange, Peckshield, Beosin, Numen Cyber\nHundred is a Compound fork which uses hTokens to track lending positions. It was audited in Feb 2022 by WhiteHatDAO.\nAs Daniel Von Fange points out:\nthe project setup two wBTC cTokens, one of which was used by the UI, one of which was empty.\nUsing a flashloan of WBTC from Aave, the attacker was able to donate large amounts of WBTC to the empty hWBTC contract, manipulating the exchange rate between hWBTC and WBTC. To top it off, the redeemUnderlying function contained a rounding error.\nAttacker’s address (OP, ETH): 0x155da45d374a286d383839b1ef27567a15e67528\nHack tx 1: 0x6e9ebcde…\nHack tx 2: 0x15096dc6…\nPeckshield summed up the exploit as:\nThe root cause appears the attacker donates 200 WBTC to inflate hWBTC's exchange rate so that even a tiny amount (2 wei) of hWBTC can basically drain current lending pools.\n\nBeosin also provided a step-by-step analysis:\nThe root cause is that the attacker can manipulate the exchangeRate by donating a large amount of WBTC to the hWBTC contract.\nIn the getAccountSnapshot function, the value of exchangeRateMantissa relies on the amount of WBTC in the contract.\nThe attacker flashloaned 500 $WBTC, then called the redeem function to redeem the previously staked 0.3 WBTC.\nNext, the attack contract 1 sent 500.3 WBTC to attack contract 2. Contract 2 used 4 BTC to mint 200 hWBTC. The redeem function was then called to redeem the 4 BTC.\nHere the attacker can redeem the 4 WBTC previously staked with less than 200 hWBTC. At this point the attacker had a very small amount of hWBTC left on contract 2.\nAttack contract 2 then sent 500.3 WBTC to the hWBTC contract and borrowed 1021.91 ETH via the remaining 2 hWBTCs.\nFinally the attack contract 2 repaid the previous debt by using 1 hWBTC, and withdrew 500.3 WBTC from the contract.\nThe attacker bridged most of the stolen funds to ETH where centralised stables USDT and USDC were swapped, or deposited into Curve.\nAt the time of writing, the hacker’s debank profile shows approximately $5.4M of assets on Ethereum and $0.9M remaining on Optimism.\nThe price of HND token dropped around 50% over the day following the hack. It has since recovered somewhat, to ~$0.025, down from ~$0.039 before the attack.\n\nAs we wrote last time:\nForks upon forks create a house of cards. If the code is copied and pasted, vulnerabilities can open up where they're least expected.\nWhen one fork falls, all others have to check their foundations.\nHundred have advised other COMP forks to get in touch, warning that the hack exploited “a general flaw in the code and not specific to Hundred deployment”.\nLikely spurred on by Euler Finance’s recent success, the Hundred team have announced a reward for info leading to identification of the hacker:\n48h passed since we sent an on-chain message to the hacker and tried to start negotiations with him.\nToday we are launching a $500k reward in the hope that this provides additional incentive for info that leads to the Hundred attacker’s arrest and the return of all funds.\nHopefully the added pressure is as effective in recovering the funds…\nWill Hundred get lucky?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nThe hackers are really spoiling us this week with our fourth helping of the exact same meal.\nCan you ever really get tired of a classic?\nBurgerSwap was the next in a growing line of protocols to fall victim to the same hack that has been causing issues in recent weeks.\nSince the market crash, this type of Drive-thru convenience exploit has been flavour of the month, and yet protocols still seem completely oblivious to this weakness in the contract. It’s as if they welcome these hacks with open arms, turning their backs to the counter and feigning surprise as people leave without paying.\nIt certainly appears as though even the easiest jobs can be royally messed up. BurgerSwap simply had to copy UniSwap’s code and yet there was something missing from their order.\nThe question has to be asked, was this negligence? Or something a little seedier?\nBack to flipping burgers...\n\nAt around 3 am on May 28th (UTC+8), $7.2M was stolen from #BurgerSwap in just 14 servings.\nThieves managed to make off with the following:\nAnd each attack looked like this:\nFlash swap 6k WBNB ($2M) from PancakeSwap.\nSwap almost all WBNB to 92k BURGER on BurgerSwap.\n\nHackers created their own fake coin (a non-standard BEP-20 token) and formed a new trading pair with $BURGER of 100 fake tokens and 45k BURGER.\nThe 100 fake tokens were then swapped to 4.4k WBNB through the pool from step 3.\nAttacker then made another swap from 45k BURGER to 4.4k WBNB.\n\nIn total the attacker received 8.8k WBNB for the two latest steps.\nSwap 493 WBNB to 108.7k BURGER on BurgerSwap.\nRepay flash swap.\n\nCredit: @FrankResearcher\nThis exploit was made possible by the fact that the attacker could do reentrance and make a second swap before reserves, which are used to calculate the number of tokens in swaps, were updated.\nInterestingly though, this seems to have been enabled by by a missing x*y=k check. Something which was present in the original univ2pair contract but was seemingly removed in this instance.\nIt seems unlikely that the developers at BurgerSwap would be so careless in their coding but what is the alternative? With the x*y>k check removed, anyone can trigger a swap of any output size while paying only one unit of the input token, a deal straight from the saver menu.\n\nThe number of hacks we have seen of projects on the BSC over the past week has been off the charts. This whole situation is eerily reminiscent of what happened in Autumn last year on ETH. A disappointing special offer which no-one wanted to see make a return.\nWhile no-one likes to see the customers get short changed, it is increasingly difficult to find sympathy for rogue, copycat entrepreneurs who try to emulate and profit from a tried and tested recipe, but who don’t care enough about the consumer to check the ingredients of their products, risking the health of the very people they derive profit from.\nThat said, if you eat at a McDaniels or Burger Duke, are you not at least partly responsible for your own indigestion?\nBurgerSwap claims they are in the process of producing a detailed compensation plan for their customers. A welcome relief for many whose stomachs have been turned by this whole affair.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

With that jacked-up multiplier inflating effectiveFee1e9 past 100%, the villain executed a flash loan to scoop up most of the tokens and contract the pool.\nFinally, a small single-token withdrawal minted an egregiously large amount of liquidity tokens due to an underflow error, allowing the drainer to easily repay the flash loan and skip town with $6.8 million in ETH.\nAccording to an analysis of the incident from Beosin, the LP Pool lacks permission verification. The attacker directly invoke the velocore__execute function (0xec378808) of the LP contract with a carefully constructed parameter to manipulate the feeMultiplier parameter of the contract.\n\n\nThe value of feeMultiplier affects the number of tokens exchanged. The attacker then used the manipulated feeMultiplier parameter to call the execute function (0xd3115a8a) again through the router contract to drain funds from the LP pool.\nAttacker Address:\n0x8cdc37ed79c5ef116b9dc2a53cb86acaca3716bf\nExploited Contracts:0xed4e130f6f9e68918996f7e1e46a3306b3e12cec\n0xb7f6354b2cfd3018b3261fbc63248a56a24ae91a\n0xc030fba4b741b770f03e715c3a27d02c41fc9dae\n0xf7f76b30a301524fe76508546B1e3762eF2B9267\nAttack Transaction 1:\n0xed11d5b013bf3296b1507da38b7bcb97845dd037d33d3d1b0c5e763889cdbed1\nAttack Transaction 2:\n0x37434e674efc4e7cfeed7746095301ace5636028906fe548b786ead286e35eb0\nAttack Transaction 3:\n0x4156d73cadc18419220f5bcf10deb4d97a3d3f7533d63ba90daeabc5fd11ba17\nFinal Fund Destination (Before Tornado Cash):\n0xe4062fcade7ac0ed47ad794028967a2314ee02b3\nDuring the exploit, Linea team halted the sequencer to prevent additional funds bridging out, due to the inability to get in contact with Velocore. “This was the last resort action to protect users on Linea”, the network wrote on X.\nWhile Linea stated its goal was to eventually take away the ability to halt the network from its team once significant decentralization had occurred, the protocol defended the decision to halt the chain.\n\"Most L2s, including Linea, still rely on centralized technical operations which can be leveraged to protect ecosystem participants. Linea's core value is a permissionless, censorship-resistant environment so it was not a decision we took lightly,\" the network wrote.\nVelocore has initiated negotiations with its attacker to recover the $6.8 million in stolen ETH, they are offering 10% as a white hat bug bounty reward.\nAccording to official documents, Velocore claims to have undergone three rounds of audits, completed by Zokyo, Hacken and Scalebit in August of 2023.\nWith their pedal stuck to the metal on insecure code, Velocore has driven itself into a ditch, do they have enough horsepower left to get themselves out?\n\nFor a protocol that boasted multiple audits and solidified security, Velocore is now looking more like a rusty junker left for scrap after this $6.8 million drain.\nWhile dangling a 10% bug bounty carrot, Velocore has yet to lure the hacker out from their Tornado Cash hideout.\nAt this rate, the team may need to invest in psychic mediums to communicate with the drainer from the other side.\nThe question is whether this was an isolated crash, or just the first fender bender in a longer line of recurring collisions for Velocore.\nWith so many blindspots somehow missed in their audit cycle, cautious crypto travelers may want to steer clear until this project gets completely overhauled from the chassis up.\nMaybe Velocore finds a way to get their motors humming again or will this exploit force them to permanently park their DeFi dreams in the junker lot?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Using flash loans, the attacker manipulated the plvGLP price reported by Lodestar’s GLPOracle contract, allowing them to “borrow” all the funds supplied on the platform.\nThe Lodestar docs state that:\nwe are relying on Chainlink Oracles for accurate pricing (with the exception of plvGLP)\nAn inviting note for any would-be attackers…\nSolidity Finance summarised the root cause:\nThe GLPOracle did not properly take into account the impact of a user calling donate() on the GlpDepositor contract, which inflates the assets of the GlpDepositor contract, and therefore the oracle-delivered price of the plvGLP token.\nLodestar’s preliminary post mortem gives further details of the exploit, as well as pointing out that “the oracle can’t be allowed to undergo instantaneous change within the same block.”\nCertik’s report contains a full step-by-step of the attack flow.\nAttacker’s address 0xc29d94386ff784006ff8461c170d1953cc9e2b5c\nExample exploit tx: 0xc523c630…\nThe 343 ETH ($430k) necessary for the attack was bridged from Polygon three months ago. Following the exploit, the funds were swapped to ETH, bridged back to mainnet and dispersed to multiple addresses.\n\nManipulating the price of collateral has been a popular attack technique since the beginning of DeFi, but especially in recent times, as this incident follows the attacks on both Mango and Moola Markets, who lost $115M, and $8.4M respectively, in October.\nThe above examples had funds partially or fully returned, ensuring users didn’t totally lose out. Yet two days have now passed since the initial attack on Lodestar, and no mention of any planned reparations has yet been made.\nForking an existing project, even long-standing and resilient protocols, does not guarantee the same security.\nBut this paragraph in the Lodestar documentation suggests they may not have realised as such…\nLodestar is a Compound fork at the core, and Compound has some of the most battle-tested contracts in all of DeFi. We have added code to support a few changes we have made, namely adding Arbitrum support, DPX, MAGIC and plvGLP support, tweaking some Interest Models, and a few other small changes.\nTime is the best security audit of all, but smart contract changes render even the most time-tested protocols open to new vulnerabilities.\nAnother market manipulated, more millions misplaced, and the market manipulators move on…\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nDeFi is a volatile protoscience.\nWhen a protocol becomes caput mortuum, doctor rekt is on hand to study the elements and document the process, including the final reaction.\nThe Alchemix post-mortem shows how modern-day alchemists almost succeeded at safely creating gold out of the ether.\nAlchemix's initial offering allowed users to deposit DAI and take a loan in alUSD, representing the future yield generated by their deposit. Over time, the loan is repaid with the yield, and thus; the transmutation is complete.\nHowever, when the team tried to expand their accepted collateral to include deposits of Ether, their experiment took an unexpected turn...\n\nWhen the same process was implemented with ETH, (minting alETH in return), some users discovered that the protocol assigned them no debt.\nUsers were able to use their alETH as well as withdraw the ETH that was supposed to be locked as collateral.\nAfter being notified that their own users were exploiting them, the Alchemix team reacted quickly, and temporarily paused the minting of new alETH while they worked to find a solution.\nThis reverse-rugpull has left alETH undercollateralized by ~2700 ETH, or ~$6.5M at time of writing; a debt which must now be repaid by Alchemix.\nThe protocol has made a public appeal to their users to return the funds and help repay the debt.\nWe spoke to Alchemix co-founder Scoopy Trooples to find out if he thought the appeal would be successful.\n\nrekt:\nHi Scoopy. It’s been two days now since the bug was found, how has the incident affected you and your team?\nScoopy:\nIt's been stressful, but thankfully we have had a lot of support from our community and people all over the industry. We are confident in our ability to get alETH solvent again, and we are extremely fortunate that no user lost funds in this incident. Going forward our team will exercise an even greater abundance of caution in all areas of our operation. We realize that protocols are lucky to get second chances, and almost never get third chances. Our team is committed to being better and learning from our mistakes so we never repeat them.\nrekt:\nAlchemix had over $1b TVL at the time of the incident, that’s a lot of responsibility - can you give us some insight into how you felt when you were alerted to the issue?\nScoopy:\nHaving such a high tvl comes with an incredible burden. When we first realized something was wrong, the first thing we did was to pause the contracts. Constant worry filled my mind and it felt like my blood was on fire as we researched in the war room to find the root cause. We found relief when we got to the answer and realized all funds were safe, but still knew we had a lot of work to make things right.\nrekt:\nAlchemix made a public appeal for users to return the withdrawn funds - how successful has that been?\nScoopy:\nWe have had many in the community say they will do it but we have not yet started the program. We will have a portal up on our app page in a few days where users can voluntarily return their free eth or alETH. We will see how far that gets us, and are weighing several options for how to cover whatever doesn't get returned. We'll be sure to include community feedback in whatever course of action we end up taking.\nrekt:\nHow many users took the opportunity to withdraw “free” ETH?\nScoopy:\nIn the end, it will be anyone who borrowed alETH. The bug repaid all the debt, so even those who wish not to exploit this incident have no choice but to.\nrekt:\nHow will the missing $6.5m affect the future development of the protocol?\nScoopy:\nIt all depends on how much our users give back. If we get > 25% of it, our treasury's non-ALCX holdings of approx $4m will be able to cover it. It will mean we will not be able to be as aggressive in hiring and marketing for some time, but we will recover since we have good cash flow. If we have a more tepid response to the voluntary returning program, then we will explore further measures  to make it solvent. We have been offered help from many in the space, so we have some solid options.\nrekt:\nThanks Scoopy. Any final message for our readers?\nScoopy:\nWe are conducting an internal review to ensure we can eliminate mistakes and errors. We thank the DeFi community for all the support and will move forward more battled-hardened and wiser.\n\nIt seems the Alchemix team are confident that they can take on this debt and continue to build.\nThe power of a loyal community can not be understated in DeFi, especially when a protocol requires some forgiveness. Despite this embarrassing incident, some users never lost faith in Alchemix, like this user who used the misappropriated funds to re-invest straight back into the protocol.\nWill the rest of the community return the required 25%, or will the Alchemists have to create a different solution?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

A whopping 58 million ASTRO tokens pilfered, with 33 million making a bridge trip to Neutron.\nOn Neutron, the stolen ASTRO tokens were removed from the exploiter’s wallet via TokenFactory Force Transfer.\nThe remaining 20 million ASTRO on Terra?\nBlacklisted faster than a Trumper in Hollywood.\nASTRO fell roughly 56% in the aftermath of the attack, according to Coingecko data.\nAttacker’s address on Terra:\nterra1wrve5z5vsmrgy6ldcveq93aldr6wk3qmxavs4j\nAttacker’s address on Neutron:\nNeutron16wynag7xgfy35sp8c5ls25c0je7dydmvq5pnd8  \nThey also bridged some funds to Ethereum and swapped to ETH.\nBridge transaction:\n7E28A2BDD3A6DBED27269C23D0BDA2FBE4B2BE7F613E87CC23A237DA473F14E2\nAddress on Ethereum:\n0xBDe173c4C2249d3a98cD6ed844a4421728114F5A\nThe boy who cried wolf, except the wolf was real.\nIn a twist that adds a layer of frustration to this incident, it turns out that vulnerabilities had been flagged by Jacob Gadikian, a former prominent figure in the Cosmos ecosystem.\nGadikian had recently highlighted the risks, but his warnings were largely dismissed by those in a position to act.\n\"This is why I stopped: coordinated harassment endured while making security reports,\" Gadikian stated following the hack.\nJacob even shared a solution to mitigate the issue.\n“When there's a security patch in comet, IBC, cosmos, etc, that shows in go.mod and that is why I automated it. This PR changes two files, go.mod and go.sum”\nGadikian added, \"If amulet were doing what I did, this would not have happened. It is trivial to set up monitoring for all cosmos chains based on go.mod. I know, cause I did.\"\nHis experience raises troubling questions about the ecosystem's approach to security and its treatment of those who raise alarms.\nHowever, in an ecosystem as intricate and often contentious as IBC, it's important to note that there are often multiple sides to every story.\nAdding fuel to the dumpster fire, it seems Terra's dev team may have been taken out at the knees.\nAs pointed out by gabrielShapir0, Terra/TFL patched the vulnerability back in April, only to accidentally un-patch it in a later update. With TFL potentially running on a skeleton crew post-SEC action, such an oversight was perhaps inevitable.\nZaki Manian confirmed, \"Terra was part of the original vulnerability coordination but they accidentally reverted the patch in the June upgrade.\"\nThe exploit's success may be partially attributed to the reduced capacity of the Terra team following the SEC's actions against Terraform Labs.\nThe SEC's actions, meant to protect investors, may have inadvertently left the henhouse door wide open.\ngabrielShapir0 could not have summed it up better, the SEC shuts down TFL, no one is left to patch known a Terra vulnerability, someone mints infinite $ASTRO and dumps it to oblivion. Slow clap for the SEC.\nAs the Astroport saga unfolds, we're left with a patchwork of patched and unpatched vulnerabilities, ignored warnings and regulatory aftershocks.\nTerra's phoenix-like resurrection seems to have inherited more than just its predecessor's name.\nIn this blockchain Groundhog Day of exploits and finger-pointing, how many more project implosions must we endure before crypto prioritizes unbreakable security over the blame game?\n\nThe Astroport exploit serves as a stark reminder of the fragility within our blockchain ecosystems.\nFrom overlooked vulnerabilities to regulatory pressures, the crypto world faces challenges on multiple fronts\nThis exploit could have been prevented and there could likely be more than one party at fault.\nFrom developers reverting patches to ignored warnings and regulatory actions leaving projects understaffed.\nThis tangled web of oversights and missteps reveals a systemic vulnerability in how the ecosystem approaches security.\nThe IBC community now faces a crossroads.\nWill it continue down the path of reactive patches and finger-pointing or forge a new way forward with proactive security and collaborative problem-solving?\nThe stakes are high in defi, can we afford to keep treating security as an afterthought rather than a fundamental pillar?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

To note, some of Halborn’s findings were approval related, this exact issue was not highlighted.\nClearly the other warriors on the battlefield were up for the challenge, because it only took them less than 2 months to find cracks in Seneca’s armor.\nPost-hack, others in the community claimed they were getting booted from Discord for reporting the bug.\nClearly Seneca knew there were issues, but chose the reckless route.\nRevoke approvals if you were unfortunate to invest in this disaster.\nEthereum:\nPT-ezETH: 0x529eBB6D157dFE5AE2AA7199a6f9E0e9830E6Dc1\napxETH: 0xD837321Fc7fabA9af2f37EFFA08d4973A9BaCe34\nPT-weETH: 0xBC83F2711D0749D7454e4A9D53d8594DF0377c05\nPT-rsETH: 0x65c210c59B43EB68112b7a4f75C8393C36491F06\nArbitrum:\nPT-weETH: 0x11446bbb511e4ea8B0622CB7d1437C23C2f3489b\nstEUR: 0x7C160FfE3741a28e754E018DCcBD25dB04B313AC\nPT-aUSDC: 0x4D7b1A1900b74ea4b843a5747740F483152cbA5C\nwstETH: 0x2d99E1116E73110B88C468189aa6AF8Bb4675ec9\nPT-rsETH: 0x2216E32006BB80d20f7906b88876964F9AF68aFb\nBad decisions or just another bad protocol?\nCredit: Crypto Smith, Seneca, Spreek, Beosin Alert\nThe exploit took advantage of a bug in Seneca's code to drain assets from users who had active approvals to certain contracts.\nThe attacker used constructed calldata parameters to call transferfrom and transfer tokens that were approved to the project's contracts to the attacker's address.\nThis allowed the exploiter to steal any undeployed LSTs from the user's wallet.\nContracts couldn’t be paused due to a bad implementation of the pause function. Because the pause and unpause functions are internal, there is no way to call them.\nThe exploiter even stole 50k senUSD from the Seneca’s team’s address. 50K that was approved 33 days earlier, but never deployed. Should we wonder why?\nOver 1.9k of ETH was stolen involving various LSTs that were swapped for ETH.

Instructing users to revoke approvals. But the damage was already done.\nA few hours later, Seneca posted an onchain message on X addressing a Whitehat, requesting the funds be returned for a 20% bounty.\nShortly after, the hacker returned 1,537 ETH to the Gnosis Safe address and transferred 300 ETH to 2 new addresses.\nAddress 1: 0x0C77350C4BDe539FfCee261A149dbc6e6afDA517\nAddress 2: 0xa07c64E55F52AAf5c361321CF01b316eCbddB5A9\nThey claim a post-mortem will be published once all of the information is collected.\nThe exploiter's address behind the attack was funded 5 months ago through FixedFloat. It remained dormant, until shortly before the attack was carried out on Seneca.\nFollow the flow of funds:\nWill Seneca do their due diligence or continue the pattern of irresponsibility?\n\nThe warning signs were there from several in the Web3 security community. Everybody sounded the alarm, except Seneca.\nSeneca acted bulletproof with their battle tested (i.e. forked) code. A team member, in a since deleted Tweet bragged about their pristine code, all while trashing Sherlock in the process.\nClaiming no legal liability is a nice shady cherry on top of this hot mess.\nThere is a thin line between cockiness and ignorance and Seneca fell face first on one side. Which side do you think it is?\nMaybe they should have spent more time getting their code locked tight instead of marketing a broken project.\nThere is no such thing as having too many eyes on your code. The more audits, contests and security reviews the better.\nThe worst case scenario was likely avoided, thanks to the attacker returning most of the funds, but this could have been avoided.\nIf you don’t pay the white hats to try to break your code, they'll be forced to make an example of you.\nBut given the way Seneca handled this situation, can you blame them?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The Inverse oracle “misuses the balances of assets in the pool to directly calculate the LP token price.”\nBy using the flash loaned WBTC to make large swaps through the underlying pool, the balance of assets was manipulated before and after borrowing, allowing the exploiter to withdraw an inflated amount of DOLA.\n1: Flashloan 27,000 WBTC via AAVE\n2: Deposit 225 WBTC to crv3crypto with 5,375 crv3crypto minted\n3: Deposit 5,375 crv3crypto to y Curve-3Crypto with 4,906 yvCurve-3Crypto minted\n4: Deposit 4,906 yvCurve-3Crypto to Inverse Finance as collateral\n5: Swap 26,775 WBTC to 75,403,376 USDT to manipulate the collateral price\n6: Borrow 10,133,949 DOLA, which is extremely more than normal\n7: Reverse swap 75,403,376 USDT to 26,626 WBTC\n8: Swap 10,133,949 DOLA to 9,881,355 3Crv\n9: Remove 9,881,355 3Cry to get 10,099,976 USDT\n10: Swap 10,000,000 USDT to 451 WBTC\n11: Repay flashloan\nFunds were then withdrawn from the contract and swapped to ETH, 1000 of which have been deposited into Tornado Cash, and 68 remain in the address.\nExploiter’s address, funded via Tornado Cash 2 mins before exploit: 0x7b792e49f640676b3706d666075e903b3a4deec6\nExploit contract: 0xf508c58ce37ce40a40997c715075172691f92e2d\nExploit tx: 0x958236…\nWithdrawing 100k USDT from the contract: 0x3d2f86…\nWithdrawing 53 WBTC ($1.1M) from the contract: 0x9959f8…\n\nPeckshield further confused matters after the attack by suggesting that the malicious tx had in fact been executed by a front-running bot, who had sniped the tx before the exploiter.\nOthers disagreed with the claim, and as the address was funded, and then the loot laundered, via Tornado Cash so quickly. It seems unlikely that we’re dealing with an accidental attack, however, it’s not hard to imagine such a turn of events happening in the future.\nAfter two hacks in such quick succession, and with bad debt making up over half of the protocol’s 20M TVL, will Inverse be able to survive this crypto winter?\n\nIf you enjoy our work, please consider donating to our Gitcoin Grant.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

And although the exact vulnerability is still to be uncovered, some clues have emerged.\nBut fear leads to rumours…\n…and separating the signal from the noise is no easy task.\n\nCredit: OtterSec, CIA Officer\nEarly reports of missing funds from Phantom wallet users were followed by accounts of an identical breach affecting Slope wallets, with mobile users making up the majority of victims.\nIt quickly became established that exploited addresses had been signing the transfers directly, i.e. this wasn’t a simple, but widespread, case of phishing for malicious approvals.\nHowever, that meant something far more worrying; the private keys to the affected addresses were compromised.\nWas there a leak in a browser extension? Mobile malware? Others suspected something deeper, such as an ECDSA nonce reuse issue (as in the case of Anyswap, now Multichain), though it seems unlikely that all 8k addresses would have made the 2+ transactions necessary for such an exploit.\nNews even broke of a widespread malware attack on GitHub repositories, though was quickly dismissed as coincidental and overblown.\nEach new theory added to the confusion, and as the community battled to make sense of the exploit, the only safe havens seemed to be hardware wallets or even CEXs.\nAnd all the while, amid the chaos, the number of drained accounts (currently around 8k) continued to grow.\nAt least one Ethereum address is also known to be affected. Potentially as a result of porting a common seed phrase between the two chains.\nWith theories ranging from leaky extensions to a mobile malware epidemic to a bug in the underlying cryptography… it remains to be seen exactly how so many users came to be affected.\nHowever, Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko points to an “iOS supply chain attack”, affecting users who have their “key imported or generated on mobile”.\nIn order to help cut through the noise, any affected users should fill out this form.\nWhile investigations into the root cause continue, attention has also been directed towards the exploiter addresses.\nOne whitehat took it upon themselves to DDOS the attacker, slowing their progress, but causing downtime for block explorers in the process. Another anon even claims to have obtained the exploiter’s info by sending an NFT linked to an image, which logged the IP that sent the request when viewed.\nThe four exploiter addresses identified on Solana hold a total of $5,276,392.50 at time of writing:\nHtp9MGP8Tig923ZFY7Qf2zzbMUmYneFRAhSp7vSg4wxV ($3,618,270.02)\nCEzN7mqP9xoxn2HdyW6fjEJ73t7qaX9Rp2zyS6hb3iEu ($955,601.51)\n5WwBYgQG6BdErM2nNNyUmQXfcUnB68b6kesxBywh1J3n ($446,965.00)\nGeEccGJ9BEzVbVor1njkBCCiqXJbXVeDHaXDCrBDbmuy ($255,555.97)\nThis dashboard provides a useful breakdown of the stolen funds, including by token type (50% USDC, 35% SOL, 15% Other) and affected wallets by loss (top 3: $246k, $125k, $100k).\n\nWhile Solana’s appeal has always been focused on (somewhat exaggerated) claims of speed and affordability, will such a widespread attack erode users’ trust in the security of the ecosystem?\nThough this incident is unrelated to Solana’s underlying tech, it will be hard to shake the stigma that jumpy retail users will ascribe to the network.\nThe price of SOL did show a noticeable drop around the time the news broke, but there has been no major crash, suggesting that the panic is now fully under control.\nBut the cryptosphere is wary, yesterday’s attack on Nomad Bridge was as chaotic in its execution as today’s rumour mill. No surprise, then, that CT (as well as your anonymous author) loves a good conspiracy theory…\nIn this wild-west industry, the promise of short term gains often blinds users to the basic tenets of personal security:\nUse a hardware wallet, diversify risks, and don’t go chasing APYs across risky bridges.\nBut is it ever enough?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Or did it merely fail to patch an existing one?\nIn the fast-paced world of DeFi, even routine upgrades can become ticking time bombs.\nA trail of addresses and transactions emerged, painting a clearer picture of the exploit:\nAttack Contract:\n0xEd4B3d468DEd53a322A8B8280B6f35aAE8bC499C  \nShezmu Attacker (created contract):0xA3a64255484aD65158AF0F9d96B5577F79901a1D  \nAttack Contract created:\n0x39328ea4377a8887d3f6ce91b2f4c6b19a851e2fc5163e2f83bbc2fc136d0c71\nThe attacker didn't just stumble upon a vulnerability; they crafted a bespoke contract to exploit it.\nSometimes in the world of DeFi, your greatest threat might be the anonymous dev next door.\nBut even the most carefully laid plans can go awry in the volatile realm of crypto.\nDuring the exploit, Chaofan Shou noticed something interesting:\n“Due to low liquidity, these $4.9M worth of $ShezUSD are swapped to only $700K.”\nCould a master heist have been foiled by market mechanics?\nAs news of the attack spread like wildfire through the crypto-sphere, Shezmu's team didn't waste a moment.\nWithin hours, Shezmu's team sprang into action, issuing a statement urging users to steer clear of the dApp while they investigated.\nShezmu reached out to the attacker with an offer they hoped couldn't be refused: a 10% bounty in exchange for the safe return of the funds.\nThe message was clear - play ball, and we'll call it a white-hat hack. Refuse, and face the full force of the law.\nBut our hacker wasn't about to fold so easily.\nThe on-chain conversation unfolded with surprising civility, considering millions were at stake.\nThreats of legal action met with polite rebuttals, and in the end, a deal was struck.\nShortly after, the funds began trickling back.\nShezmu confirmed recovering the stolen funds, minus the agreed-upon bounty, and stated a post-mortem is forthcoming.\nStolen Funds Returned:\n0x058a453abb03803aacfcc94cbeb410ceb56aa8aa2edb4ad3efa3e78522980cba\nThe community watched in real-time as a potential catastrophe transformed into a masterclass in crisis management.\nIn the aftermath, Shezmu emerged battered but not beaten.\nBut here's where the plot thickens. Remember that low liquidity mentioned earlier? Turns out, it might have been the key to this whole resolution.\nAs Chaofan Shou, our eagle-eyed first responder, pointed out:\n\"Due to low liquidity, these $4.9M worth of $ShezUSD are swapped to only $700K.\"\nSuddenly, that 20% bounty on the full $4.9 million starts looking pretty attractive, doesn't it?\nIn the end, was it the threat of legal action, the allure of a hefty bounty, or a hacker's change of heart that saved the day?\nOr perhaps, it was the cold, hard math of a liquidity crunch that turned our black hat white.\n\nWhile Shezmu’s swift negotiation saved the day, it can't erase the glaring oversight in their security practices.\nShezmu failed to scrutinize their September 3rd contract upgrade, leaving the door wide open for an enterprising hacker.\nIn the end, was it skill or luck that kept Shezmu from total ruin?\nTheir hasty 20% bounty might have saved millions, but it's a band-aid on a bullet wound.\nAnd the soundtrack to this all-too-familiar scene?\nCue the broken record music - another exploit after an upgrade.\nIn DeFi, yesterday's patch is tomorrow's exploit, and every upgrade is a roll of the dice.\nIn a world where code is law, but human error is constant, who's really in control - the devs, the auditors, or the hackers waiting in the wings?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The protocol's Avalanche deployment, where another $4.1M would soon vanish. Different chain, same painful lesson.\nDeltaPrime, in a rare display of speed, quickly confirmed what everyone already knew: they'd been thoroughly rekt. Again.\nAt this point, they should probably just laminate their \"We've Been Exploited\" announcement template.\nBut how did this overachieving exploiter school DeltaPrime for $4.85 million?\nThe exploit combined two vulnerabilities with the elegance of a well-planned heist and the subtlety of a sledgehammer.\nAccording to CertiK's detailed analysis, here's how DeltaPrime got schooled:\nThe Arbitrum Exploit kicked off our exploiter's masterclass.\nAttacker Address on Arbitrum:0xb87881637b5c8e6885c51ab7d895e53fa7d7c567\nA flash loan of 59.9 ETH set the stage, supplied to DeltaPrime like bait in a trap. 1.18 WBTC was borrowed and immediately redirected through a swap adapter to their attack contract.\nAttack Contract on Arbitrum:0x52ee5c0ea2e7b38d4b24c09d4d18cba6c293200e\nUsing DeltaPrime's reward mechanism like a personal ATM, they retrieved their ETH collateral through an arbitrary input vulnerability.\nFirst Blood on Arbitrum:0x9efe855cd3783462207ff8a3d94dc17a74e2b2f00bf1b4c8a7e0135dae83ab5c\nThe stolen funds were initially aggregated into the following contract before being distributed:0x52EE5c0eA2E7b38D4B24c09D4d18cba6C293200e\nOn Arbitrum, the $753K was split three ways:0x56e7f67211683857EE31a1220827cac5cdaa634C (49.91 ETH)0x101723dEf8695f5bb8D5d4AA70869c10b5Ff6340 (16.62 ETH)0x21032a57bb6cfed765b7b5543fe00a3831b1325dacd3c42b6e98db033da8f5da(2.96 WBTC bridged to Ethereum)\nNot content with a mere appetizer, our exploiter turned their attention to Avalanche's richer hunting grounds with equal ease and nearly six times the payoff.\nAvalanche Massacre followed the same recipe.\nAttacker Addresses on Avalanche:0xd5381c683191EB0999a51567274abAB73a9Df0AD0xd3d535141831f6bd8b7df92e2ae0463d60af2413\nThe periphery adaptor contract flaw proved just as fatal on a different chain.Another $4.1M vanished faster than promises of \"guaranteed yields\".\nFirst Avalanche Strike:0xece4efbe11e59d457cb1359ebdc4efdffdd310f0a82440be03591f2e27d2b59e\nBut here’s where this heist took an unexpected turn – rather than rushing off, our enterprising exploiter decided to put the stolen funds to work.\nOn Avalanche, the stolen bounty found a new purpose, generating yield.\nFarming Operations:\n$600K of Staked USDC staked through Stargate\n$518K USDC/USDT providing liquidity on LFJ\n4,865 AVAX for good measure\n49.68 WETH.e because diversification is key\n6.34 BTC.b to round out the portfolio\nStolen Funds on Avax:0xd5381c683191EB0999a51567274abAB73a9Df0AD (465.35 AVAX)0xd3d535141831F6Bd8B7DF92E2AE0463D60Af2413 (69,401 AVAX)\nMost exploiters treat stolen funds like a hot potato – tumbling, mixing, and sprinting for the hills faster than a validator during a network outage.\nNot our ambitious apprentice.

We are still looking into the code. Tokens were minted and sold into the LP.\nGamma Strategies was hit with a similar mint exploit earlier this year, resulting in a similar loss on Arbitrum.\nSuper Sushi Samurai’s code was audited, but failed to identify the infinite mint exploit.\nWill some of these protocols and auditing firms ever get this right or keep dropping the ball?\n\nCredit: Spreek, Super Sushi Samurai, Coffeexcoin, Sudo\nThe Super Sushi Samurai LP was drained due to a critical bug in the token contract that allowed users to double their token balance simply by transferring the entire balance to their own address.\nThe issue stemmed from a coding oversight in the contract's transfer function. When transferring tokens, the contract subtracts the amount from the sender's balance before adding it to the recipient's balance. However, if the sender and recipient are the same address, the contract fails to account for the deducted amount, causing the balance to double instead of remaining unchanged.\nThis exploitable loophole enabled the attacker to repeatedly double their balance and ultimately sell the artificially inflated holdings, resulting in a $4.8M loss for the project.\n\nIt only took the attacker around an hour to flip $35 into $4.6M. Quite a profit, isn’t it?\n\nAttacker Contract:\n0xDed85d83Bf06069c0bD5AA792234b5015D5410A9\nAttacker Address: 0x6a89a8c67b5066d59bf4d81d59f70c3976facd0a\nAttack Transaction 1: 0x80012bf784b83baaf28f5549a9f233cae5f70be7afcd8f594dc757d431ed93c4\nAttack Transaction 2: 0x62e6b906bb5aafdc57c72cd13e20a18d2de3a4a757cd2f24fde6003ce5c9f2c6\nAttack Transaction 3: 0xac3400e3d536ac23c10fdd2c06e1faf8d5de5b797df8433e9b5ab74b102a4e35\nHowever, the funds may not entirely be lost. The person who drained the funds sent a message saying that it was a whitehat rescue hack. They provided details for contacting them and said that users should get reimbursed. The project said it had reached out to the exploiter.\nVerichains was responsible for the audit and missed the exploit.They let the contract go live with an infinite mint exploit.\nAnother audit, another exploit. Is it time to start auditing the auditing firms?\n\nIn the aftermath of the Super Sushi Samurai exploit, it's crucial for the crypto community to reflect on the importance of thorough security audits and the role of auditing firms in ensuring the safety of users' funds.\nThe incident raises concerns about the effectiveness of current auditing practices, given that the contract was audited by Verichains but still went live with an infinite mint exploit.\nThis event serves as a reminder for both projects and users to remain vigilant and ensure the highest security standards are being met.\nCollaborative efforts should focus on improving smart contract development standards and establishing industry-wide best practices.\nIt may be time for the industry to consider stricter auditing requirements and establish better mechanisms for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in smart contracts.\nBy working together to develop more robust security measures and promoting transparency in the auditing process, the crypto community can foster an environment where users feel confident in the security of their investments.\nMoreover, the Super Sushi Samurai incident should serve as a catalyst for reevaluating the relationships between projects and auditing firms.\nWhile the outcome of the Super Sushi Samurai incident remains uncertain, with the exploiter claiming to be a whitehat hacker and offering to reimburse affected users, it provides an opportunity to reevaluate and improve the overall security landscape.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

You may withdraw your funds if need be. Our vaults will continue to be managed normally for now, but deposits are currently shut down until we identify and mitigate the problem.\nWhen Orbit lost over $80M at New Year, we asked:\nCan we do better this year?\nSo far, it’s not looking good…\n\nCredit: Gamma Strategies, CharlesWang, PeckShield\nGamma published a thread outlining the preliminary cause of the exploit. However, a full post-mortem is forthcoming. Paladin’s CharlesWang outlined a potentially similar attack vector.\nFlash loans were used to manipulate the value of deposits, allowing the attacker to mint an inflated number of LP tokens.\nDespite four desposit protection measures, the attack was viable due to the broad ranges in allowed price changes within certain vaults. Deposits remain paused on Gamma vaults, as it is during deposits that the attack vector arises.\nAs Gamma explained:\nThe main issue is with the settings we placed on (2) the price change threshold.\nIt was placed too high allowing for up 50-200% price change on certain LST and stablecoin vaults. This allowed the attacker to manipulate the price up to the price change threshold and mint a disproportionately high number of LP tokens.\nPeckshield provided an attack flow:\n\nAttacker address (ETH, ARB): 0x5351536145610aa448a8bf85ba97c71caf31909c\nAttack contract 1: 0x4b57adc00ac38f74506d29fc4080e3dc65b78a69\nExample attack tx: 0x025cf285…\nThe majority of funds were bridged back to the hacker’s Ethereum address. USDT was then swapped out for ETH for a total of 1535 ETH ($3.4M). Approximately $1.1M of DAI and gDAI remains on Arbitrum, however total losses to Gamma may have been higher.\nThe attacker was funded via Tornado Cash two and a half hours before the attack began.\nThe team has contacted the attacker on-chain, seemingly hoping for a whitehat. But the 1000 ETH deposited into Tornado Cash doesn’t paint an optimistic picture.\n\nCollateral damage threatened a number of other projects…\nFirst, Crypto Algebra suffered reputation-wise from the initial mis-labeling, then other protocols paused their contracts out of an abundance of caution. DEXs Camelot and Quickswap were also keen to point out that the issue was not with their own code.\nHowever, BlockSec did note a series of smaller scale attacks on similar protocol Dyson Money.\nGamma Strategies has a somewhat chequered past.\nBefore rebranding, the protocol then known as Visor Finance suffered three incidents in 2021 alone.\nIn June they defended the loss of $500k via a privileged function as “not a rug”, then in November they downplayed another hack as “economic arbitrage”.\nDecember 2021’s loss of $8.2M to an infinite mint bug seems to have been the nail in Visor’s coffin, with the rebrand and token migration announced two days later.\nHowever, it bears mentioning that Gamma has had no issues since the rebrand, with apparently “no original developers or founders remaining from the project”.\nThe protocol has undergone three audits, from Consensys Diligence (March 2022), Arbitrary Execution (March 2022), and Certik (July 2021), but given that the vulnerability was due to the configuration of individual pool’s price change tolerances, the bug is likely out of scope.\nAs we press on into 2024, it seems the constant stream of hacks and exploits shows no sign of slowing down.\nAnd if we do see a new bull run, at this rate it will surely eclipse the madness of last time.\nStay safe out there…\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Our hacker friend wasn't done cooking.\nThey multi-called several other addresses including the $USDO stablecoin contract and minted themselves a jaw-dropping five quintillion $USDO.\nBecause why settle for millions when you can have quintillions?\nFollowing the crypto equivalent of a high-speed chase, our blockchain sleuths tracked the stolen funds as they were bridged to the BNB Chain.\nAs of press time, the suspicious address sits pretty with approximately $4.4 million in stablecoins like BSC-USD and USDC. Not a bad day's work for our digital desperado.\nTapioca DAO finally broke their silence - a mere 6 hours after the attack.\nTheir official response? A classic case of \"it's not a bug, it's a feature.\"\nAccording to Tapioca, this wasn't just any old hack - oh no, this was a \"social engineering attack.\"\nApparently, the attacker managed to compromise the TAP token vesting contract's ownership, allowing them to claim and sell a whopping 30M vested TAP.\nBut wait, there's more! The USDO stablecoin contract's ownership was also compromised, with the attacker adding a minter to infinite mint USDO and drain the USDO/USDC LP pair.\nTapioca's damage report? A cool 591 ETH and 2.8M USDC stolen. At least they're consistent with the blockchain detectives on this one.\nThe attack centered on Tapioca's vesting contract, a piece of code that was supposed to keep tokens locked up tight.\nTAP Vesting Contract:\n0x2997C5ddD3070A46E9938261ce0A16a237121cb0\nExploiter:\n0x70285a11489bed93686410EBC727057CAfb8129D\nAttack Transaction 1: 0x8cf8def40fa2beab66f46863478bea71ad8f4512003caf2fa639cc5a00550753\nAttack Transaction 2: 0x1abb8cf0b0af2ce19a30ce5103d51269d4600d9aeba045260feb588db89d76a4\nAttack Transaction 3:0x174c3deaf563be1bb6d873ba279421e8588acc888ef672bafd5efe7441aae74f \nBut our hacker wasn't satisfied with just one course.

Our favorite on-chain sleuth, ZachXBT, has stirred the pot with some spicy observations.\nAccording to Zach, this Tapioca tempest might be connected to a string of recent hacks targeting projects like Nexera, Concentric, Masa, SpaceCatch, and others.\nThe common ingredient in this hacker's cookbook?\nMalware, possibly served up through fake job listings.\nIt seems in the world of DeFi, \"We're always hiring!\" could be code for \"We're always hacking!\"\nAnd here's where it gets really interesting - Zach hints at a potential connection to everyone's favorite boogeyman of the crypto world: North Korean state-sponsored hackers.\nBut just when you thought this story couldn't get any wilder, Tapioca serves up a plot twist that would make M. Night Shyamalan jealous.\nIn a stunning turn of events, they've managed to pull a reverse uno card on the hacker.\nTapioca announced in their Discord: \"We have hacked the hacker! Recovered 1000 ETH which is now safely in the DAO multisig. The 1000 ETH was DAO collateral within Big Bang Origins to mint USDO for USDO/USDC LP.\"\nWith this recovery, Tapioca's treasury now stands at $4.2M.\nThe team promises more details in the upcoming post-mortem, crediting Seal911 and EnigmaDarkLabs for their assistance in this counter-operation.\nAs Tapioca continues to work on resolving the situation, this story is far from over and should make for another interesting post mortem.\nAnd because no crypto disaster is complete without a side of phishing, scammers quickly moved in, impersonating Tapioca DAO and dropping malicious links like breadcrumbs.\nHacken's warning to users? Don't take the bait.\nWell, somebody took the bait. But was it a Tapioca team member who swallowed the phishing hook, line, and sinker?\nDid our hacker chef serve up a specially crafted \"job opportunity\" that was too tasty to resist?\n\nAfter Tapioca's $4.4 million stumble, we're left with a familiar taste of incompetence garnished with a side of North Korean intrigue.\nIt's another entry in the \"How Not to DeFi\" handbook, where your protocol is just one compromised key away from being the next cautionary tweet thread.\nThe security game has leveled up, evolving from smart contract bug hunts to a twisted version of \"Who's the Mole?\"\nWhile we've gotten better at auditing our code, we've forgotten to run a virus scan on our devs.\nRogue actors aren't just in our programs anymore; they're writing them.\nThey're in our VS Code extensions, our job applicant pools, and probably in that weird Discord server you joined last week.\nAt this rate, every Web3 project will have their very own pet North Korean hacker by 2025.\nForget \"bring your dog to work day\" - it's now \"bring your state-sponsored cyber-criminal to work day.\"\nIn this crypto clown fiesta, where your next colleague could be coding for Kim Jong-un on the weekends.\nIs this the cyberpunk future we were promised, or just a really elaborate phishing scam that we're all falling for?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Apparently, Poly still thought that an even lower bar was acceptable.\nThe team eventually acknowledged the attack, informing users that bridging services had been paused and making a call for help to the security community. In a follow-up, Poly clarified that “57 assets have been affected on 10 blockchains”\nPrompting flashbacks of the first hack, which at the time totalled more than the entire rest of the leaderboard combined, initial reports used a notional value of $42B of minted assets.\nBut low liquidity on destination chains meant the attacker was only able to cash out a few million.\nIt seems we only ever hear of Poly Network when they’re hacked…\n…who knew they were even still around?\n\nCredit: Dedaub, Beosin\nIn contrast to Poly’s last incident, this time appears to be a far simpler case of compromised keys; three of four multisig signers validated deposit proofs, granting the attacker access to funds.\nThe attack process involved locking a small amount of tokens on one chain, then withdrawing a larger amount on a different chain via forged proofs, repeated for various assets and chains.\nA full, technical post-mortem can be found here.\n\nAttacker’s main ETH address: 0xe0Afadad1d93704761c8550F21A53DE3468Ba599\nExample tx: 0x1b8f8a38… (deposit on ETH), 0x5c70178e… (withdrawal on BSC)\nEthCrossChainManager contract: 0x14413419452aaf089762a0c5e95ed2a13bbc488c\nAlthough the notional value of assets minted reached into the tens of billions, the attacker could only access around $4.4M of Poly’s liquidity, with further assets remaining in the attacker’s address.\n\nA full list of assets stolen by chain is available here.\n\nBlockchain bridges create bottlenecks where funds accumulate on either side, often secured by a flimsy threshold of just a few EOAs.\nTime and again we have seen hundreds of millions lost to just a few signatures.\nLast time Poly was rekt, on-chain negotiations resulted in a happy ending, as funds were returned and the whitehat offered a Chief Security Advisor role on top of a $500k bounty.\nLuckily, far less was lost in this time.\nWill Poly learn their lesson?\nOr will they go for the hat trick?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Set to parameter to the desired address, which receives the minted volume\n5. Repeat x times\n\nCredit: @cmichelio\nOver on BSC, the exploit targeted a total of 20 tokens, according to ChainSwap’s post-mortem.\nTaking the example of the NFT platform WilderWorld, this is one of 40 repeated transactions, each of which minted 500,000 $WILD tokens each time.\nThese 20M WILD were then sold for ~650 WBNB, or just over $200,000 USD via PancakeSwap, effectively depleting the WILD/WBNB pool in the process.\nBy the time the hacker was finished, their wallet had filled with a variety of tokens, with a total value of approximately $4.4M.\n\nThe evidence is present in the attacker's Ethereum wallet taking the form of a long series of 0.005 ETH transactions, each evidence of freshly minted tokens via the Chainswap bridge.\nThe last few transactions show the attacker cashing out some of the ETH that had been bridged from BSC, via 1inch - a series of 5 transactions totalling 456 ETH, or approximately $935,000 at the time of writing.\n\nIf the bridge isn’t the target, then it’s part of the escape route for this new style of cross chain attack.\nBSC, Solana, Polygon, are all seeing increased activity, and as the liquidity grows, the loopholes will show. This won’t be the last time we see this type of hack.\nWe didn’t cover the initial exploit. With so many to choose from, we need to set some standards. If it’s under a million dollars lost then there has to be something that piques our interest.\nHowever, when we looked back at the first post-mortem, we found this email that we thought might interest you.\n\nA strange correspondence that the ChainSwap team claims to be from their attacker.\nOr did the “great people” at ChainSwap just send it to themselves? Everyone is free to speculate...\nWe are left wondering... why would the hacker fund his wallet with money from Tornado and then change his bounty into a centralised stablecoin such as USDT?\nThis leaves him vulnerable to having his funds frozen by Tether, and he hasn't tried to cover his tracks.\nIs this a ChainSwap insider trying to prove a point, or has the email sender with “fake KYC accounts” returned for more?\nWhy has this money still not been laundered?\nChainSwap have arranged a full compensation plan for those affected by the attack, but the reputation of their platform can’t be refunded.\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link… Who will break next?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The smart contracts are also subject to a bug bounty program on Immunefi.\nBut it was a compromised private key that ultimately tried to blow up the lab, audits and bug bounties became an afterthought at that point.\nThe $4.3 million-dollar question remains: Just how did this sly exploiter manage to phish or finagle those highly-coveted vault keys?\n\nThe AlexLab team has their work cut out unraveling this $4.3 million private key caper.\nWhile they've managed to recover some assets and freeze funds, millions are still sitting in the exploiter's shady wallets.\nTheir proposed solutions of treasury grants and token reissuance show they're pulling out all the stops to make impacted users whole.\nBut at the end of the day, that won't undo the damage of sloppy opsec that enabled this breach in the first place.\nThe day-long delay to make the exploit public is concerning.\nAs investigators dig deeper into the phishers' tricks or if this is a potential inside job, this saga will be a case study in the perils of private key mishandling.\nThe crypto Wild West is an unforgiving place, one mistake is all it takes for your vault to get looted.\nAlexLab can audit and bug bounty till the cows come home, but they'd be wise to quickly implement multi-sig and other robust key management practices.\nOtherwise, their shiny \"finance layer\" risks getting stripped bare by the next opportunistic vault raider.\nA raider who may be a repeat offender and is not afraid to use different attack vectors, who could be next?\nThe game of crypto cat-and-mouse wages on.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nLightning does strike twice.\nConic Finance got double-rekt on Friday, losing a total of $4.2M from their ETH and crvUSD omnipools.\nOmnipools accept single asset deposits, which are then spread across a variety of Curve pools to earn LP rewards for depositors.\nAs the news spread, Conic quickly acknowledged the first attack, which drained the ETH pool of $3.3M. Following the second incident, the team decided to shut down all pools.\nThe initial hack was yet another instance of the notorious read-only reentrancy vulnerability which has wreaked havoc on DeFi over the last year. Sturdy Finance, Midas Capital and dForce Network, amongst others, have all suffered from the issue in recent months.\nBoth attacks were frontrun, with the recipient of funds from the second incident (an MEV bot) returning 90% of their profits (81 ETH) the following day.\nWith the majority of lost funds (over 1700 ETH) still sitting in the address of the first attack’s frontrunner, there is still hope for recovery…\n…but given the address had previously been labelled by Blocksec as “LadyPepe Token Exploiter”, we probably shouldn’t hold our breath.\n\nCredit: BlockSec, Conic Finance\nThe first attack exploited the common read-only reentrancy vulnerability in order to manipulate token prices, as discussed in many previous articles.\nIn this case, the attack can be summed up with the following TLDR by pcaversaccio:\nTL;DR: Due to a read-only reentrancy vulnerability in the oracle contract CurveLPOracleV2, the attacker can reenter rETH-f.totalSupply() (and other tokens like steCRV) and thus can manipulate the prices accordingly. Thus, the attacker can withdraw more than deposited.\nA more detailed breakdown can be found in Daniel Von Fange’s thread.\nAccording to auditors Peckshield, the vulnerability was identified in the audit, however a new oracle contract reintroduced the bug.\nFWIW, our audit identifies a similar read-only reentrancy issue. However, the same issue is introduced in the newly introduced CurveLPOracleV2 contract, which was not part of the audit scope.\nConic dev 0xWicket later clarified that the contract did have inbuilt reentrancy protection, however it wasn’t triggered due to a mix-up between ETH and WETH addresses.\nWe are currently in the process of writing a post-mortem. The root cause of this being exploitable was our assumption that ETH was treated as address 0xeee... by Curve, while it uses the the WETH address for V2 pools. Our reentrancy protection failed to trigger because of that\nExploiter address (1st attack): 0x8d67db0b205e32a5dd96145f022fa18aae7dc8aa\nOver 1700 ETH (around $3.3M) was forwarded to a secondary address: 0x3d32c5a2e592c7b17e16bddc87eab75f33ae3010\nExploit tx (1st attack): 0x8b74995d…\nOriginal failed tx (1st attack): 0x97a8315e…\nOriginal exploiter address (1st attack): 0x10db234e02c3889d8e408c7084e8ce10892bdad7\nThe second attack was somewhat simpler and far less damaging, apart from to Conic’s reputation. The issue was described in Conic’s post-mortem as a type of sandwich attack on imbalanced pools.\nThe attack steps are as follows:\nExchange crvUSD to USDC in the Curve pool\nDeposit crvUSD into Conic\nExchange USDC to crvUSD in the Curve pool\nWithdraw from Conic\nRepeat steps above\nThe report goes on to explain that:\nThe attacker would benefit from the exchanges in the Curve pool by exchanging at a favorable rate. While we did have some mechanism in place to ensure we did not interact with imbalanced Curve pools, the bounds that we had set were not tight enough and allowed the attacker to slowly drain funds from the pool.\nA total of approx. $934,000 was stolen from the crvUSD Omnipool, giving the attacker a profit of approx. $300,000.\nExploiter address: 0xb6369f59fc24117b16742c9dfe064894d03b3b80\nExample hack tx: 0x37acd17a…\nFrontrunning bot (returned 81 ETH): 0xd050e0a4838d74769228b49dff97241b4ef3805d\n\nFor all the talk of the Curve Wars, the wider ecosystem feels Conic's pain.\nThe Curve team got involved in warning users of the dangers, and even suggesting safe havens for farmers.\nConic’s was one of the most hotly anticipated DeFi projects before launching earlier this year, and was seen by some threadoors as a contender for being the next cycle’s CVX/Yearn.\nPre-hack, CNC was sitting at around $6. News of the initial incident caused a drop in price of around 35% with a further fall to just $1.72 following the second exploit. CNC has since settled at around $2.75, just below half of its pre-hack value.\nThe TVL chart shows just how much damage Friday’s events have done, with less than a third of Conic’s pre-hack TVL remaining:\n\nWill such a promising protocol survive this double-blow?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Specifically, the doTransferOut() function will invoke the transfer() function of the ERC677-based token, which will eventually lead to an external call.”\n\n\nThe above process was used repeatedly to take $USDC, $FUSD, $WBTC, $WETH & $FUSE.\nThe resulting funds were first bridged to Ethereum (originally funded by Tornado Cash) and then sent on to this address, where they remain in the form of ETH, WBTC, USDC (will Circle freeze these funds?) and FUSE, worth approximately $3.1M.\n\nWhen Agave and Hundred fell victim to the same attack vector, we said;\nWhen one fork falls, all others have to check their foundations.\nVoltage Finance didn’t do that, and that’s why they’re taking their place (#64) on the leaderboard.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Total loss is around $3.8M.\"\nMeanwhile, the Onyx team seemed to be practicing their ostrich impressions.\n4 hours after the exploit, they finally poked their heads out of the sand:\n\"Onyx Protocol is aware of unusual activity on our platform and is currently reviewing third party post mortem examination data while conducting our own investigation.\"\nBut by then, the digital safe had long been cracked open, its contents scattered to the winds of the blockchain.\nAs blockchain detectives pieced together the digital crime scene, they found themselves watching a rerun of \"Precision Manipulation: Onyx Edition.\" Same vulnerability, different day.\nHacken, playing the role of DeFi's CSI team, laid out the attack blueprint.\nOur intrepid hacker, clearly a fan of sequels, followed a script we've seen before:\nKick things off with a 2K ETH flash loan from Balancer. Because why use your own money when you can borrow someone else's?\nPlay the ETH shell game: deposit 1,999.5 ETH into the oEther contract, while sneaking 0.5 ETH into a malicious contract cooked up just for the occasion.\nUse this custom contract to mint and redeem oETH in amounts so small, they'd make even a satoshi blush. We're talking 0.00000001 oETH here, folks. Because in DeFi, size doesn't always matter.\nRinse and repeat this minting and redeeming dance 56 times. Because if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try, try... (you get the idea) again.\nWatch as the exchange rate goes haywire, proving once again that in DeFi, it's not about the size of your transaction, but how you use it.\nThis precision manipulation attack exploited a vulnerability that's becoming all too familiar in the Compound V2 family reunion.\nThe flaw? A hiccup in the asset's exchange rate calculation when there's low liquidity in a market.\nIt's as if Onyx left the door wide open, hung up a \"Free Money\" sign, and went on vacation.\n\nExploiter address:\n0x680910cf5Fc9969A25Fd57e7896A14fF1E55F36B  \nAttack transaction:\n0x46567c731c4f4f7e27c4ce591f0aebdeb2d9ae1038237a0134de7b13e63d8729\nAttack Contract:0xAE7d68b140Ed075E382e0A01d6c67ac675AFa223\nBut wait, there's more! Our enterprising hacker didn't stop there.\nPeckshield, playing the role of DeFi's Sherlock Holmes, uncovered another skeleton in Onyx's closet.\nThe attacker also exploited a flaw in the NFTLiquidation contract, which failed to properly validate user input.\nThis allowed them to inflate the self-liquidation reward amount, essentially giving them a blank check drawn on Onyx's account.\n\nThe end result? A smorgasbord of stolen assets according to Peckshield:\n4.1M VUSD\n7.35M XCN\n5K DAI\n0.23 WBTC\n50K USDT\nAll in all, a $3.8M payday for our hacker, and another painful lesson for Onyx Protocol.\nOne they've already learned... and apparently forgotten.\nSpeaking of forgetting, in the Pokémon world, Onix evolves into Steelix, becoming stronger and more resilient.\nBut in DeFi, Onyx Protocol seems stuck in a permanent state of vulnerability, as if it used an Everstone on itself.\nNo matter how many times it gets hit by super-effective exploits, it never learns a new move.\nIt's less \"Rock Throw\" and more \"Self-Destruct\" at this point.\nCertiK audited Onyx back in January 2022, and since then? Radio silence. No updates, no follow-ups, nada. At least publicly.\nIt's as if Onyx thinks smart contracts are like fine wine - leave them alone and they'll get better with age. Spoiler alert: they don't.\nMeanwhile, Onyx decided to play Russian roulette with their protocol, adding a VUSD market via governance proposal.\nBecause who needs a fresh audit when you're introducing new markets, right?\nApparently, Onyx's idea of spring cleaning is sweeping old vulnerabilities under the rug while rolling out the red carpet for new ones.\nThey didn't just skip a few steps; they took the express elevator to Rekt City, bypassing all the safety floors along the way.\nIn a world where \"move fast and break things\" meets \"copy-paste and pray,\" is DeFi innovation outpacing common sense, or is common sense just taking a very, very long lunch break?\n\nIf this story gives you a sense of déjà vu, you're not alone.\nWe've been here before, folks. In our previous coverage of Onyx's misadventures, we highlighted a crucial point: while Certik did their audit dance, the real vulnerability lurks in the market conditions, not just the codebase.\nRemember the golden rule of Compound V2 forks? Empty markets are like catnip for hackers.\nLaunching new markets should be handled with the care of a bomb disposal expert, not a \"yolo and hope for the best\" attitude.\nAfter the Hundred Finance sequel hack, Hexagate dropped some wisdom:\n\"Mint some cTokens, burn them, and make sure the total supply never hits zero. It's like DeFi's version of always leaving one cookie in the jar.\"\nBut did Onyx listen?\nApparently, their memory is shorter than a goldfish's, and their learning curve flatter than a pancake.\nIn the grand theater of DeFi, Onyx has managed to turn \"once bitten, twice shy\" into \"twice bitten, still clueless.\"\nAs the curtain falls on this repeat performance, one can't help but wonder: in a space where code is law, who's writing the constitution? And more importantly, who's bothering to read it?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

More specifically, the value of function get_virtual_price can be manipulated by reentering it during the removal of liquidity.”\nAnd Curve have provided a known workaround:\none can call any method which has the nonreentrant lock (removing 0 liquidity is probably the cheapest).\nThe attacker's ETH address was funded via Railgun on mainnet, before being used to fund OP and ARBI addresses via Synapse.\ndForce sent transactions (OP, ARBI) offering the attacker a bounty via tx input data.\nFortunately, the hacker responded days later.\ndForce announced that funds had been returned to the project's multisigs and:\nAll impacted users will be made whole, we will announce the details for distribution of the funds over the next few days.\n\nBut this isn’t the first time dForce has got rekt.\nBack before rekt.news, in what seems like the distant past of April 2020, dForce lost $25M to an ERC-777 vulnerability. Users were reportedly refunded days later.\nMore recently, though, Layer 2 networks have been enjoying a boom in adoption.\nOf the most popular ETH L2s, Optimism is currently the only one with a token, and OP’s recent all time high is a sign of its growing popularity.\nBut with increased usage and higher TVL comes extra attention from those who seek to profit by any means necessary...\nAirdrop hunters are everywhere and, although they may only stick around until they get what they came for, they are generally harmless.\nBut speculators aren’t the only ones on the lookout for the next big thing.\nSo far, we have covered relatively few incidents on L2s, but we expect that to change as blackhats seek out new opportunities…\nThis won’t be the last L2 entry on our leaderboard.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

He later stated that the protocol is now safe to use, and the exploited contract has been removed, as well as promising a full post-mortem on events.\nAmongst the chaos, DeFi’s favourite villain got rekt for 1800 ETH, and there was plenty of whitehacking activity.\nOne user claimed to have targeted 0xSifu as a whitehat, though the attempt appeared to have been botched, with only 100 ETH eventually returned.

Users were either drained or revoked quickly, and whitehat efforts certainly helped to soften the PR blow.\nEver since its launch, though, Sushi has been surrounded by drama.\n2020’s DeFi summer saw Sushi come onto the scene in dramatic fashion, quickly establishing itself as one of DeFi’s darlings, alongside Uniswap, Curve, Aave and Compound.\nHowever, a period of stagnation during the 2021 bull run ended in infighting. Then, in October, the new head chef, Jared Grey’s, murky past in a variety of struggling projects drew suspicion.\nSushi seems to be a good case study for DAOs working, until they don’t.\nA small team of highly-motivated devs can disrupt the DEX landscape in just weeks. But once the excitement wanes, a bloated team can get too comfortable with inactivity and apathy (or simply farming a project’s treasury).\nGrey receiving an SEC subpoena, criticism of a paltry bug bounty programme, and large operating expenses (including 500k for Grey himself)...\nIt appears the drama is far from over for Sushi.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

        "article": "\nKraken accuses security researchers of extortion after $3M bug bounty exploit.\nA cybersecurity firm's disclosure of a critical vulnerability in Kraken's systems has escalated into accusations of extortion and threats between the parties.\nChief Security Officer Nick Percoco disclosed that Kraken received a bug bounty program alert from a security researcher in early June.\nSecurity research firm Certik revealed that they discovered the bug.\nHowever, rather than cooperating to address the issue, Kraken allegedly responded by threatening CertiK employees and making unreasonable demands, as claimed by CertiK.\nThe conflicting claims have devolved into a public he-said-she-said dispute, with each party accusing the other of questionable behavior.\nIn this strange and unsettling situation, can we truly trust the guardians of our digital fortresses?\n\nCredit: Nick Percoco, Certik, Tayvano, Immutable Lawyer\nWhile initially vague, the report claimed to have found an \"extremely critical\" bug that allowed inflating account balances on the cryptocurrency exchange.\nNick Percoco stated that Kraken's security team promptly investigated the matter and discovered an isolated bug that allowed a malicious attacker, under the right circumstances, to initiate a deposit onto our platform and receive funds in their account without fully completing the deposit.\nWithin an hour and 47 minutes, Kraken had deployed a fix to resolve the issue.\nCertiK alleges their investigation uncovered more alarming vulnerabilities in Kraken's systems beyond the initial bug report.\nAccording to CertiK, their testing confirmed the ability to fabricate deposits into any Kraken account, withdraw large sums of fabricated crypto exceeding $1 million, all without triggering any alerts for multiple days.\nCertiK claims that after responsibly reporting these critical findings, which Kraken itself classified at the highest severity level, the exchange then threatened CertiK employees with demands to repay a \"mismatched amount\" of crypto within an \"unreasonable time\" without even providing wallet addresses.\nThe security firm alleges Kraken's threats came after CertiK had already assisted in successfully identifying and remediating the vulnerabilities.\nCertiK states they have gone public to protect users and urge Kraken to cease making threats against ethical security researchers acting in good faith.\nThis contradicts Kraken's portrayal of the initial $3 million incident as clear extortion by bad actors.\nCertiK asserts they followed responsible vulnerability disclosure practices in coordination with Kraken initially.\nFurther analysis revealed that the bug had already been actively exploited in the preceding days across three accounts associated with the original researcher's colleagues.\nOne account controlled by the researcher had deposited a mere $4, seemingly to validate the vulnerability.\nUltimately, the exploitation of a vulnerability in Kraken's systems enabled the withdrawal of over $3 million dollars from Kraken's corporate wallets over a five-day period by abusing the same flaw.\nCertiK claims that the transactions were merely testing deposit transactions, with millions being withdrawn from the system for testing purposes.\nCertik asserted that millions of dollars of crypto were minted out of air, and no real Kraken user’s assets were directly involved in our research activities.\nNotably, they underlined that despite numerous fabricated tokens being generated and exchanged for valid cryptocurrencies over several days, no risk control or prevention measures were enacted until CertiK brought the issue to light.\nWhen Kraken requested that the illegally obtained funds be returned per its bug bounty policy, the researchers refused and instead demanded a speculative ransom payment based on hypothetical maximum losses.\nThis $3 million exploit formed the basis of Kraken's claim of extortion by bad actors.\nHowever, CertiK alleges this demand was in response to Kraken's own threats after CertiK reported even more severe vulnerabilities.\nIt should be worthy to note, according to Kraken’s Bug Bounty page, the max pay out for a Critical severity is capped at $1.5 million.\nStrangely, 3 transactions made by the same address conducting these “tests” made 3 deposits to Tornado Cash almost 2 weeks ago.\nTornado Cash Deposit\nTornado Cash Deposit\nTornado Cash Deposit\nIf it turns out that Certik was routing funds through a Tornado Cash, a sanctioned virtual currency mixer, the legal implications could be massive.\nTime will tell who was in the wrong here, clearly someone really screwed up.\nAre we venturing into a realm where the lines between ethical behavior and exploitation blur, akin to crossing over into the enigmatic realm of the Twilight Zone?\n\nWith both parties trading accusations of extortion and threats, the matter has devolved into a heated he-said-she-said quagmire.\nKraken insists it took reasonable actions to protect itself after ethical boundaries were crossed.\nCertiK maintains it followed industry best practices for vulnerability disclosures and responsible coordination.\nCaught in the crossfire of this public spat are the users and broader crypto community.\nAs fingers get pointed in both directions, maybe the truth about what actually transpired will be established.\nWhose narrative will prove credible?\nWhat if there is another version of the story that has yet to be uncovered, such as a rogue actor?\nAs the outcome may significantly impact platform security and user safety in the crypto world, one wonders if ethics and collaboration will triumph over assertions of misconduct.\nIn light of this significant occurrence, it's important to consider the possible impact on security researchers who may be more cautious about sharing their discoveries, fearing potential involvement in similar disputes.\nAdditionally, can we fully dismiss the possibility that a rogue actor within CertiK might have played a role in the alleged exploitation, further complicating the narrative and raising questions about trust and accountability in the security research community?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or

As a result, the attacker's exchange of USDT is calculated as 5,689,000 minus 2,844,700.\nBy calling the library function creditUserAssets to update the attacking contract's ledger in the ExchangeWithAtomic contract used the exchanged USDT, resulting in the attacking contract's final deposit of USDT in the ExchangeWithAtomic contract being recorded as 5.68 million.\nFinally, the attacker withdraws the USDT and returns it to the flashloan lender and swaps the remaining 2.836 million USDT into WETH for profit. The attackers used the same method to launch an attack on the BSC chain and made $191,000 in profit.\nThe root cause of the attack was the contract exchange function is not protected from reentrancy...\nPeckshield produced the following diagram showing the basic attack steps:\n\nAttacker address 1 (ETH, BSC): 0x3dabf5e36df28f6064a7c5638d0c4e01539e35f1\nAttacker address 2 (ETH, BSC): 0x837962b686fd5a407fb4e5f92e8be86a230484bd\nExample tx (BSC): 0xfb153c57…\nExample tx (ETH): 0xa6f63fcb…\nStolen funds have mostly been deposited to Tornado Cash, with approximately $1M of ETH remaining in the Ethereum address. The attacker’s account was funded from a Binance-labelled wallet, though the original source was allegedly another CEX, SimpleSwap.\n\nIn his thread on the incident, Orion’s CEO Alexey Koloskov stated his confidence in his own team’s code:\nWe have reasons to believe that the issue was not a result of any shortcomings in our core protocol code, but rather might have been caused by a vulnerability in mixing third-party libraries in one of the smart contracts used by our experimental and private brokers.\nBut when such large amounts of money are on the line, security must be considered at all levels of a project’s stack.\nAnd it appears that this $3M loss has motivated Orion to take a more controlled approach:\nMoving forward, any and all contracts will be developed in-house to eliminate any potential vulnerabilities from third-party libraries. Our focus is to fortify the Orion Protocol and make sure it remains robust.\nGlad to hear Orion will be taking security more Sirius-ly.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Then, shortly before midnight UTC, the implementation was upgraded in order to siphon user funds from addresses which had approved the proxy.\nThe pattern is described as follows:\n...when users exchange, they authorize the TokenApprove contract, and the DEX contract transfers the user's tokens by calling the TokenApprove contract. The DEX contract has a claimTokens function that allows a trusted DEX Proxy to make calls, with its functionality being to invoke the claimTokens function of the TokenApprove contract to transfer tokens authorized by the user. The trusted DEX Proxy is managed by the Proxy Admin, and the Proxy Admin Owner can upgrade the DEX Proxy contract through the Proxy Admin.\nOnce compromised:\n...the Proxy Admin Owner upgraded the DEX Proxy contract to a new implementation contract through the Proxy Admin. The new implementation contract's functionality is to directly call the claimTokens function of the DEX contract to transfer tokens.

The proposal would have transferred $1.3M remaining in the DAI-USDC-USDT liquidity pool to the attacker’s address, but they were unable to gather enough tokens to force the vote through.\nThis week’s case serves not just as a reminder to revoke old token approvals, but highlights the importance of carefully monitoring governance processes, even on defunct projects.\nFor Atlantis, it looks like it’s back to the murky depths…\n…for good this time.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

However, no official response came for almost three hours, when a team member acknowledged the loss.\nIn the meanwhile, and while TG mods were urging users “Please don’t fud” the protocol was hit by a repeat attack, though for substantially less profit ($~62k).\nMany protocols have fallen victim to repeated exploits of identical vulnerabilities over the course of the year, with read-only reentrancy also claiming multiple victims including Conic, Sturdy, EraLend and Midas.\nAre the devs paying attention?\n\nCredit: Peckshield, BlockSec\nThe exploit was made possible due to a known vulnerability of Compound v2 code. Under certain conditions, a rounding error allows an attacker to manipulate empty markets in order to drain liquidity from across the protocol.\nIn Onyx’ case, governance had recently voted through Proposal 22 to add a lending market for memecoin PEPE to the protocol.\nThe ‘empty market attack’ involves taking a flash loan which is swapped, in this case, for PEPE. Then, by minting a small number of shares (oPEPE) and donating a large amount of PEPE to the pool, vastly inflating the price of oPEPE for use as collateral on Onyx.\nOther assets can then be borrowed against the overvalued oPEPE, draining the protocol’s liquidity. The rounding error is then exploited to withdraw the donated funds, and the flash loan is repaid.\n\nExploiter address: 0x085bdff2c522e8637d4154039db8746bb8642bff\nAttack tx: 0xf7c21600…\nRepeat exploiter address: 0x5083956303a145f70ba9f3d80c5e6cb5ac842706\nRepeat-attack tx: 0x27a3788d…\nThe 1164 ETH ($2.1M) of profits were sent on to an intermediary address before 1140 ETH were deposited into Tornado Cash.\nThe remaining 24 ETH were sent to on-chain panhandlers, prompting a follow-up stream of input data messages to the hacker’s address, begging for further scraps.\n\nOnyx Protocol was audited by Certik, however the viability of this vulnerability is ultimately determined by the conditions within the individual market, rather than the codebase in itself.\nEmpty markets in Comp v2 code are a known issue; the launch of new markets should be treated especially carefully by project teams.\nThe discussion following the (second) Hundred Finance hack references Hexagate’s recommendations for launching potentially vulnerable markets (“markets with low total supply and a non-zero collateral factor (CF)”):\nwe recommend any Compound V2 fork, when launching new markets to mint some cTokens and burn them to make sure the total supply never goes to zero. When the total supply goes to zero, the protocol becomes vulnerable and this strategy mitigates this situation.\nThat means that when listing a new collateral token, first set its collateral factor to zero, set in the Comptroller, mint some cTokens, burn them and then change the collateral factor to the desired factor.\nCompound itself has many eyes scouring all governance proposals, though the occasional blunder does seem to slip through…\nBut with just 11 wallets voting on Proposal 22 (and over 97% of votes coming from a single address), perhaps Onyx doesn’t have the same level of community vigilance over its lending markets.\nFor teams working with forks, devs must be sure to stay on top of the security landscape, to avoid getting rekt by replicated vulnerabilities.\nBlackhats are certainly keeping up-to-date.\nOnyx’ proposed compensation plan intends to refund victims by selling native tokens from the treasury, while DAO contributors' salaries will be paused until further notice.\nWhile superficially sounding like a fair and selfless way to make users whole, the plan has the potential to trigger a death sprial on XCN, whilst the team’s incentives grow increasingly misaligned…\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Since the depositAmount X quantities[0] = 0 X 2 = 0, the attacker transfers zero Rena.\n2: Attacker uses the mintAddressLock function again to open a new position with fnftId=1028, depositAmount=0, quantities=360,000, asset=Rena, and recipients=[malicious contract]. Again, the attacker transfers zero Rena and receives 360,000 tokens (with fnftId=1028). Note that these 1028-tokens have no value now.\n3: At the end of Step 2, during the mint function of FNFTHandler, the attacker re-enters the Revest contract via the onERC1155Received interface. The depositAdditionalToFNFT function is used with amount = 1e18, quantities=1, fnftId=1027, which would normally open the fnftId=1029 (new) position. However, due to the delay in updating fnftId, position 1028 is overwritten with the above data, ascribing value to the 1028 tokens owned by the attacker.\n4: The attacker uses the withdrawFNFT function to withdraw the 360,000 X 1e18 Rena tokens after having deposited only 1 quantity X 1e18 Rena tokens in Step 3.\nToken losses (approx $2M total) according to the official post-mortem report:\n350k RENA (~$125k, still in attacker’s address)\n715M BLOCKS (~$1.7M)\n7.7M ECO (~$100k)\nSmaller amounts ($10-$12K) of ConstitutionDAO and LUKSO were also stolen.\nAfter swapping the majority of the stolen tokens for ETH, the attacker deposited the funds into Tornado Cash.\n\nA security breach is never a good look for a DeFi protocol, especially when its product is a secure locker to be trusted with other project’s tokens.\n“One audit is never enough” says Revest, as they found that the vulnerability was not picked up in the project’s audit (solidity.finance).\nThe team’s quick response and thorough post-mortem are promising signs, and although Revest have stated that “we do not possess the funds needed for meaningful financial recompense”, the postmortem report stresses the desire to make things right in the future.\nAt the moment, it’s not clear how that will happen.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

A cool $2 million vanished faster than you can say \"decentralized finance.\"\nBut here's the kicker - with uniBTC's $75 million market cap on Ethereum alone, this could have been just the tip of a very expensive iceberg.\nAs the blockchain detectives pieced together the digital crime scene, they found themselves staring at a vulnerability so basic, it would make a first-year coding student blush.\nAccording to the post mortem, the vulnerability in Bedrock's smart contracts was more complex than a simple miscalculation.\nAt its core, the issue stemmed from a failure to properly handle native tokens on non-native BTC chains.\nThe crux of the problem lay in the SigmaSupplier contract, which didn't register NATIVE_BTC.\nThis oversight caused the total supply to always register as zero, effectively neutering the caps restriction mechanism designed to prevent unauthorized minting.\nWith this safeguard unknowingly disabled, the Vault contract's checks were rendered toothless.\nThe result? A wide-open door for users to mint uniBTC tokens using native tokens on non-native BTC chains - a process that should have been impossible by design.\nIn essence, Bedrock's smart contracts were playing by the wrong rulebook, allowing users to mint uniBTC in ways the protocol never intended.\nIt wasn't so much a mathematical error as a fundamental mishandling of token types and chain interactions.\nThis mishandling opened the floodgates for a series of exploits across multiple chains.\nThe vulnerable vault contract deployed on September 25th, allowed an ETH to uniBTC exchange at a 1:1 rate.\nIn one brazen example, an attacker minted 30.8 uniBTC using 30.8 ETH and promptly sold 28.8 uniBTC for 27.8 WBTC in a single transaction.\nExploiter Address:0x2bFB373017349820dda2Da8230E6b66739BE9F96  \nAttack Transaction:\n0x725f0d65340c859e0f64e72ca8260220c526c3e0ccde530004160809f6177940\nAnd this was just one of many such attacks that collectively drained $2 million from the protocol.\nAdding insult to injury, Bedrock's response was slower than a sloth on sedatives.\nIt took them over 2 hours to publicly acknowledge the exploit after Dedaub sounded the alarm, and nearly 4.5 hours to finally pause the vulnerable smart contracts.\nIn the lightning-fast world of DeFi, that's an eternity - plenty of time for the digital horses to bolt, the stable to burn down, and the ashes to cool.\nAnd in a twist that would make any security expert facepalm, this upgrade didn't undergo an audit.\nIn the world of DeFi, skipping an audit is like going skydiving and deciding parachutes are optional.\nIt's a bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see if it pays off for 'em.\nThe fallout was swift. As word spread faster than a viral meme, the DeFi community sprang into action.\nPendle, holding a significant chunk of uniBTC, hit the brakes on their platform faster than you can say \"not my bags.\"\nMeanwhile, Bedrock's team, finally shaken from their slumber, scrambled to pause the vulnerable contracts.\nBut in crypto time, where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye, their response felt like watching paint dry.\nThe damage was done. Across eight chains - Ethereum, BNBChain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, Mode, BOB, and ZetaChain - the vulnerability left its mark.\nA total of 125 exploiters (because why let one person have all the fun?) had their field day.\nIn the end, Bedrock was left holding the bag, facing a $1.8 million hole in their liquidity and a whole lot of explaining to do.\nAs they say in the crypto world: another day, another exploit.\nBut this time, the price of skipping an audit came with a hefty price tag.\nIf Bedrock itself can crumble so easily, what kind of foundation are we really building on?\nAnd in the rush to mint the next big thing, are we creating bedrock or just burying landmines?\n\nIn the aftermath of Bedrock's $2 million face-palm moment, we're left shaking our heads in disbelief.\nHow does an unaudited upgrade slip through the cracks of a protocol handling millions?\nCan they rebuild trust after this prehistoric-level security oversight?\nIn the fast-paced world of DeFi, even the most solid foundations can shake.\nBedrock's fumble serves as a stark reminder: in the rush to innovate, we might just be building castles on quicksand.\nAs we watch this saga unfold, one can't help but wonder: in the annals of crypto history, will Bedrock be remembered as a cornerstone, or just another stepping stone on the path to \"doing better\"?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

While they still had their training wheels on back in August, memecoin BALD rugged holders for $23m.\nLess than 2 weeks later, RocketSwap was compromised for $869k, thanks to private keys that were allegedly stolen in a bruteforce attack on the project’s server.\nSince then, Base has been hitting it out of the park, hovering around $1.5b in TVL and currently ranked #6 in all chains.\nWas somebody waiting for baseball season to start back up to start stealing bases again?\n\nCredit: Grand Base, De.Fi, Peckshield\nIn the early hours of April 15th, at approximately 3AM UTC, GB, a token issued by Grand Base, experienced a drastic price movement that led to an over 90% dump.\nDue to a security breach of their deployer's wallet, the exploiter was able to mint & sell roughly 32.5m GB tokens.\nBefore the minting attack, Grand Base had a maximum cap of 50 million GB tokens.\nMalicious transactions the scammer executed in order to mint tokens:\nTransaction 1:\nhttps://basescan.org/tx/0xe8b0af9a2c7a3482958792d620328aa780097788fc18e1b7e1328a4a459132d0\nTransaction 2:\nhttps://basescan.org/tx/0x74237dfd7ac0e251311c71ff2c2536b146eeb68c465d47325bdd4517f34a7259\nAfterwards, many swaps were made in order to exchange the tokens to ETH:\nhttps://basescan.org/address/0xcfe5f1bae0da05ffe9c9c73411b8ec1a286350fc\nIn the end, ETH on BASE was bridged to Ethereum:\nTransfer 1:\nhttps://basescan.org/tx/0x519acbeb333fd43dead8bc66faa4d419d310d6bf8011a056ce279d26845da70d\nTransfer 2:\nhttps://basescan.org/tx/0x66334af4901b7d4e5e536c17fee41431aee3bde03c6da823d4d9dd5adc43aa92\nStolen funds are currently sitting in 2 wallets.\nWallet 1:\nhttps://debank.com/profile/0xd8c21702b74d14b68f2580e28c10ecc53304c274\nWallet 2:\nhttps://debank.com/profile/0xb124546f9f89f178a785d539d299e372b9dc1ec6\nThe CTO took to Telegram to provide some further insight into the exploit:\n“One of our dev had his PC hacked, the LP wallet was accessible via this PC, with control over our token contract and liquidity pool. This wallet also had the authority to mint new tokens, and proceeded to do so before the market selling them all.”\nThe CTO went on to state that the underlying dapp code is secure and can be easily forked. They claim to have intimate knowledge of every line of the codebase. However, the GB token itself will need to be relaunched following the exploit.\nAccording to the Docs on the Grandbase site, details on their contracts will be published very soon, this was last updated 6 months ago.\nMissing with their contracts are audits. Not a single audit can be found.\nWith no audits or contract information in sight, it's clear that Grand Base has struck out when it comes to security.\nWill they step up to the plate and address these issues or continue to leave their users vulnerable to future exploits?\n\nThe market has recently been going through a rollercoaster ride, experiencing dramatic highs and stomach-churning lows, leaving investors on the edge of their seats as they navigate the wild twists and turns of the volatile landscape.\nWhile Base is trying to onboard the normies to crypto, suspicious incidents like this serve as a black eye that may deter some users.\nThe Grand Base team did initially announce the exploit to their Telegram community.\nWhy did the team take 6 hours to announce on X that they were compromised?\nAmidst the turbulent market conditions, timely and transparent communication becomes even more critical in maintaining trust within the community.\nThe delay in publicly announcing the exploit on relevant channels may raise questions about the protocol's commitment to keeping its users well-informed and protected.\nAs Grand Base moves forward, it is crucial for the team to address the lack of contract audits and outdated information, ensuring that security measures are strengthened and user confidence is restored.\nOnly time will reveal if Grand Base can effectively absorb the learnings from this experience, taking the essential precautions to safeguard against future incidents, or if they'll fall into a cycle of repeating past mistakes, exposing themselves to additional security risks.\nWill they show up with their A game or continue to strike out?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Dexible’s post-mortem report (published via Telegram and Discord, in PDF format) explains:\nembedded in each request to swap was a \"route\" of what DEX to call and what data to send to that DEX to execute a swap\nHowever, the function does not check whether the router address is actually a DEX by, for example, using an on-chain allowlist:\nthe router address was not verified on-chain in any way. This meant that instead of calling a DEX smart contract, the hacker simply called a token contract with a request to \"transferFrom\" any account that had spend approval on the Dexible contract\nAttacker addresses (ETH, ARBI, BSC): 0x684083f312ac50f538cc4b634d85a2feafaab77a\nExample tx: 0x138daa4c…\nRelatively few addresses were affected, with the majority of losses reportedly coming from an address belonging to BlockTower Capital which lost 18M TRU tokens, valued at ~$1.4M at the time.\nIn total, approximately $1.5M was lost on Ethereum, and sent to Tornado Cash. A further $450k was lost on Arbitrum, which was bridged to BSC before also being washed via Tornado Cash.\n\nIn the post-mortem report, the Dexible team attempted to justify releasing unaudited code based on the experience of their team:\nA formal audit was not performed on the latest set of contracts. We had several community members and Dexible engineers review the code, and they did not find the vulnerability. The core engineer that created the contracts has over 25 years of software engineering experience, and he did not see the vulnerability. Upon reviewing one of the hacker's transactions, however, he immediately understood how it was executed.\nAn audit is not a silver bullet… but it certainly helps.\nEven the most experienced engineers may overlook a security vulnerability in their own code. Naturally, when building a new protocol, devs primarily have users in mind.\nBut in this industry, security is paramount.\nAnd no shortage of unaudited protocols have made it onto the leaderboard.\nIn Dexible’s own words:\nexploits happen in DeFi.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Must try harder.\nTwitter remains the fastest source of news for DeFi - even the DODO team relied on Luciano to tell them that their own $WCRES / $USDT pool had been drained using fake tokens.\nThe following analysis is taken from the official DODO release, with thanks to @samczsun, @tzhen, PeckShield, and SlowMist.\n\nThe exploits targeted several DODO V2 Crowdpools, namely the WSZO, WCRES, ETHA, and FUSI pools.\nIn total, approximately $3.8 million, of which $1.88 million is expected to be returned (see below for more information), was drained as a result of these exploits.\nThe DODO V2 Crowdpooling smart contract has a bug that allows the init() function to be called multiple times. This means that an exploiter can perform an attack with the following steps:\n1. Exploiter creates a counterfeit token and initialize the smart contract with it by calling the init() function\n2. Exploiter calls the sync() function and sets the “reserve” variable, which represents the token balance, to 0\n3. Exploiter calls init() again to re-initialize - this time with a “real” token (i.e. tokens in DODO’s pools)\n4. Exploiter uses a flash loan to transfer all real tokens from the pools and bypass the flash loan check\n\nIn summary, there are two individuals involved in this exploit. We will refer to them as Individual A and Individual B.\nIndividual B has all the hallmarks of a frontrunning bot, because:\nIn addition, Individual B’s exploits preceded Individual A’s successful exploits by roughly ten minutes.\nIndividual A\nIndividual A has already contacted the DODO team through samczsun and offered to send back the funds removed from DODO pools.

Pike Finance confirmed shortly after.\nThis incident followed a previous exploit related to a USDC vulnerability reported just days earlier.\nPike Finance acknowledged the initial attack, but it wasn’t enough.\nUnfortunately, the actions taken by Pike Finance after the initial exploit left the protocol open to further attack.\nAnother attack that could have been prevented.\nDoes Pike Finance have what it takes to navigate these troubled waters?\n\nCredit: Quill Audits, Pike Finance, Chain Aegis\nFool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\nPike Finance got played for the fool, falling victim not once, but twice to exploits that allowed attackers to seize control and siphon funds from the protocol.\nPike is a universal liquidity market that enables lending and borrowing using native assets directly on their respective blockchains, eliminating the need for wrapping and cross-chain transfers.\nAccording to Pike Finance, the initial exploit on April 26 was caused by weak security measures in Pike's contract functions when handling CCTP transfers.\nDuring protocol pausing attempts, an added dependency in the code altered storage layout and moved the initialized variable, causing contract misbehavior.\nSeizing this opportunity, attackers upgraded spoke contracts without admin access, successfully siphoning off funds.\nThe upgraded implementation contract of the target contract has a vulnerability, which allows the attacker to initialize and then steal the owner permissions.\nIn addition to the attack on Ethereum, the attacker also carried out attacks on Arbitrum and Optimism.\nThe two attacks stemmed from the same smart contract vulnerability, which allowed the attacker to override the contract.\nAttack Process by Quill Audits:\nThe attacker exploited the initialize function in the original contract, adding their address to the _isActive variable.\nTaking advantage of unprotected initializer functions, the attacker bypassed security measures meant to prevent multiple executions.\nBy leveraging version numbers, the attacker consumed and blocked reusable numbers, enabling them to execute new initialization steps with each upgrade.\nFinally, the attacker performed an upgradeToAndCall, implementing a malicious version of the contract and successfully breaching Pike Finance's security.\n\nApril 26 Attack on Arbitrum\nAttacker:0xAdaF1626aEC26A7937aE7d1Fa0664e6E0904C1d0\nTarget Contract:\n0x7856493B59cdb1685757A6DcCe12425F6a6666a0\nAttack Transaction:0x979ad9b7f5331ea8034305a83b5cd50aea88adec395fff8298dd90eb1b87667f\nApril 30 Attack on Multiple Networks\nAttacker:\n0x19066f7431df29a0910d287c8822936bb7d89e23\nAttack contract:\n0x1da4bc596bfb1087f2f7999b0340fcba03c47fbd\nTarget contract:\n0xfc7599cffea9de127a9f9c748ccb451a34d2f063\nAttack Transaction on Optimism:\n0x19066f7431df29a0910d287c8822936bb7d89e23\nAttack Transaction on Arbitrum Transaction: 0x19066f7431df29A0910d287C8822936Bb7D89E23\nAttack Transaction on Ethereum:0xe2912b8bf34d561983f2ae95f34e33ecc7792a2905a3e317fcc98052bce66431\nThere are no public audits or bug bounty programs for Pike Finance, both sections in their site docs state “Coming soon”.\nThey have yet to even update their contracts page and currently just list the test net contracts.\nPike had a community presale for their native PIU token at the end of March that generated $6.45 million.\nThey reached out to the initial exploiter on April 26 in an onchain message.\nThey are offering a 20% reward for the return of the funds, or information leading to the recovery of funds.\nIn addition, a report and plan to make users whole will be provided at a later time.\nAccording to many responses to the exploit announcement, many users want their presale funds back, which appear to be unaffected at this time.\nWill the team get their act together, or end up doggy-paddling in a sea of mistrust?\n\nPike Finance’s security woes raises red flags and makes one wonder, are they winging it or sinking it?\nThe absence of public audits and bug bounty programs, coupled with their failure to secure contracts after the initial exploit, paints a picture of negligence.\nThe slow response to the first attack enabled a second, putting its user base at risk, thanks to the sheer carelessness in handling the contracts.\nInvestors, particularly those who participated in the $6.45 million token presale, are understandably worried.\nPike's delayed updates and vague promises of a \"report and plan\" do little to ease their fears.\nCan Pike navigate these stormy waters, or will their cavalier attitude towards security sink them?\nOnly time will tell if Pike Finance can right the ship or if they'll serve as yet another cautionary tale of cutting corners in the world of crypto security.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Merlin then acknowledged the incident, advising users to revoke permissions as a precaution.\nNot to be confused with three-time leaderboard entrant Merlin Labs (who got rekt on repeat during Spring 2021’s BSC bloodbath), Merlin had passed its second audit by Certik just two days before the attack.\nMerlin’s story may be that of a simple rug; a tale we’ve heard many times before.\nBut, this time, Merlin has inadvertently conjured a debate into the value of certain styles of audit…\n\nCredit: BeosinAlert\nThe rug mechanism was a straightforward case of draining the liquidity pools into which users were depositing as part of the MAGE token sale.\nThis was made possible via max approvals granted to the Feeto address upon deployment of the pools. The individual/s in control of the Feeto address could then drain the pool of all assets, which were then bridged to ETH.\nMerlin’s own post-mortem places the blame squarely on the back-end development team. The thread includes links to developers’ github profiles and states that Serbian authorities have been contacted.\nAttacker address (into which funds were drained): 0x2744d62a1e9ab975f4d77fe52e16206464ea79b7\nSee Beosin’s full analysis for further details and addresses.\nThe rugged funds were bridged back to Ethereum, swapped for ETH and transferred to other addresses.\n\nThis is the first incident on zksync, a zero-knowledge Ethereum rollup whose mainnet launched in March.\nIt didn’t take long for the new environment to become a target…\nzksync already had a close call when their Twitter handle was targeted (presumably to conduct a phishing campaign) earlier this month.\nAs new ecosystems flourish, leveraging exciting tech to push our industry forward, bad actors will never be far behind.\nAnd low-effort cash grabs make the perfect honeypot for those who would pull the rug on users or would-be hackers looking for vulnerable, hastily deployed code…\nGenerally, an audit by a reputable blockchain security firm is a good sign for those unsure whether or not to ape in.\nBut when some logos look less like a mark of quality and more like a red flag, what counts as ‘reputable’?\nThe very same day that their recently-approved project was drained, Certik’s founder boasted of their volume of bargain audits in the industry.\nWith Certik’s stamp of approval on so many rekt projects, many are casting doubts on the firm's value to the space.\nIt should be noted that, in their initial audit, Certik did indeed bring up the issue of trust, recommending that the protocol take measures to sufficiently decentralise:\nWe advise the client to carefully manage the privileged account's private key to avoid any potential risks of being hacked. In general, we strongly recommend centralized privileges or roles in the protocol be improved via a decentralized mechanism or smart-contract-based accounts with enhanced security practices, e.g., multisignature wallets.\nHowever, this issue was marked as ‘Resolved’ by Certik, who stated that the Merlin team had promised to use a multisig. Enough users apparently didn’t read the audit fully, or simply didn’t care about the implications of trusting the project.\nFacing further claims that the code includes an intentional backdoor, Certik is clearly feeling the heat. The firm is considering a “community compensation plan” to cover the losses.\nQuick and dirty audits should not be deemed sufficient reassurance, especially for multimillion dollar protocols. Some personal responsibility is also necessary to stay safe…\nRuggers gonna rug.\nAnd when many protocols have centralisation issues which could potentially lead to a rug, yet are overlooked by FOMO-ing apes and airdrop hunters…\nWhere does the blame really lie?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Other users profited from the same malfunction, amounting to approximately $1.6M in stolen funds. However, while still not back at peg, the price of aUSD has remained above $0.90 since the protocol was reactivated.\nThe one billion that wasn’t.\nTornado sanctions didn’t deter these Polkadot thieves, who tried to steal ~$1.3B in aUSD from Acala Network: the self-proclaimed “DeFi Hub of Polkadot”.\nHowever, Polkadot plays differently to Ethereum, and the transfers were quickly disabled “until a pending Acala community governance decision resolves the error”.\nMeanwhile, the aUSD price chart shows an all too familiar pattern…\n\nAcala has yet to confirm the exact amount that was permanently stolen, as even with the disabled transfers, some funds still slipped through the net.\nNow we wait and we wonder, how much can Acala return or replace?\nAnd where should this go on the leaderboard?\n\nAcala stated that:\n\"We have identified the issue as a misconfiguration of the iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool (which went live earlier today) that resulted in error mints of a significant amount of aUSD,\"\nand…\n\"The misconfiguration has since been rectified and wallet addresses that received the errorneously minted aUSD have been identified, with on-chain activity tracing in respect of these addresses underway.\"\nLet’s take a look at this “misconfiguration”.\nCredit: @alice_und_bob\nThe misconfigured iBTC - aUSD pool had recently concluded bootstrapping and begun to trade. It was incentivized with aUSD, ACA & INTR.\nHowever, the incentives.claim_rewards() extrinsic in Acala wrongfully minted $aUSD in exponential amounts (1.3B in total).\nWhile most of the attention has gone toward the one user who minted 1.2b aUSD (greedy), at the same time a handful of other users exploited the situation by:\na) sending $aUSD to Moonbeam.\nb) swapping for $DOT and sending it to Polkadot.\nc) swapping for $iBTC and sending it to Interlay.\nThe $iBTC/pool was almost completely drained, but the DOT pool managed to retain some of the value, because it was a DOT - LCDOT pool and users had to go through this route, which mitigated the damage.\nThe two wallets that profited the most are listed below.\n23bmUgSeKMD8Y9triphPw5YHuiz3QUJNqcbmb3Eg9QMQDMWN\n253pFTg22JqHbLeLZupexGMDUuXAJLfEriTYkFqvGWPuwcFi\nA few other users extracted value from the misconfiguration, but it is harder to tell if they did so with bad intent.\nIn total, $1.6M in “good value” was transferred off-chain, and $4.6M of “bad debt” in the form of wrongly minted $aUSD also left the chain.\nAs Acala and Polkadot were able to so easily disable the stolen funds, we’re not left with not much to say.\nLike the stories of “compromised keys”, we simply wait and see what those in control decide to do.\nWill wrongly minted $aUSD be destroyed?\nWill they have to roll back the chain?\nAnd where should this story go on the leaderboard?!\nWe’ll let our Telegram group members decide.\nProbably.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

And with the increasing centralisation caused by liquid staking providers, the house (almost) always wins.\nShould validators be rewarded quite so generously for sitting on their stakes while searchers seek out the opportunities only to pay hefty bribes?\nOr should predatory MEV bots be grateful for any scraps they can get?\nDo either of them deserve the spoils?\n\nCredit: Peckshield\nDespite its deceptive name, we should all be well acquainted with the risks of ‘impermanent loss’ by now, Uni V3 LPs more than most.\nBut far greater risks come from within.\nIlliquid pools and fat fingers make for a dangerous combination on DeFi’s biggest DEX, where MEV bots are waiting to scoop up the spoils of even the slightest mistake.\naavebank.eth added 2M USDT of liquidity at a very out-of-range pricepoint to the UNI-USDT pair, before burning the LP position to withdraw just 99k UNI (worth $730k) just two minutes later.\nIn the meantime, MEV bot 0xfde0d1 had eaten the excess USDT worth almost $1.3M from the costly, albeit juicy, error.\nOut-of-range LP positions on V3 can be used to set limit orders. One user pointed out:\naavebank.eth has added followed a similar pattern in the past where they add $2 million USDT out of range essentially setting a limit order to buy UNI in the future. However, this time they fucked up the range and essentially offered to buy $730k UNI for $2m USDT.\nWhile the victim LP holds the ENS aavebank.eth, the address doesn’t appear to have a connection to the Aave protocol or team.\nBut that doesn’t mean experienced DeFi teams aren’t making similar blunders.\n\nIn ensuring they would be the one to grab the spoils, the bot gave up the majority of the 578 ETH profit in a 566 ETH ($1.25M) bribe paid to the validator, keeping just 2% for their trouble.\nWhile previously a niche and lucrative racket, MEV has increasingly become a race to the bottom.\nIt may be entertaining to watch the occasional examples of on-chain karma as these blockchain predators feast upon one another, but MEV bots can also be responsible for returning frontrunned hack attempts (in this case, the bot responsible is tagged on Etherscan as having thwarted two hacks to date).\nWhenever someone loses out, be it to a sandwich attack or fat-finger mishap, a blockchain predator will snap up their losses.\nBut pickings are getting slimmer as the arena becomes more crowded.\nBots willing to take the lowest profit margin are able to take it all, while validators sit back and feast on gradually more generous portions.\nWhen excess value comes directly from malicious behaviour, should the recipients feel obliged to return the ill-gotten gains?\nLido certainly doesn’t think so.\nSo will these bumper rewards simply serve to drive up rates on liquid-staking behemoths, leading to further concentration of mainnet’s validators?\nOr might it encourage more users to solo stake, hoping to hit the bribe jackpot themselves?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Over a period of 12 days the attacker succeeded in draining approximately 4% of Levana's LPs.\nThe change in PnL was initially attributed to organic trader profits and lack of effective cash and carry on Levana's smaller markets.\nYesterday the attack increased significantly during Osmosis congestion, draining an additional ~5% from the pools until the protocol was closed from new positions being opened.\nBut if it hadn’t been for the increased network traffic…\nWould they have even noticed?\n\nCredit: Levana, Carter L. Woetzel\nAccording to Levana’s post-mortem, the attack began on December 13th, before ramping up significantly on December 26th.\nThe exploit took advantage of temporary price discrepancies (delta) between oracle updates to place winning trades in “volatile markets with high leverage”.\nAlthough the attack vector is fairly simple, context is key.\nOracle updates are pushed during regular user trades, as well as from Levana’s off-chain update bot, or every 90 seconds. But by timing attacks just right, and ensuring other transactions couldn’t get through, there was a window of opportunity every once in a while…\nDuring the first stage, profits were minimal, as the exploit relied on a combination of conditions:\nYou would have to find, or artificially create, a period where two events coincide: the large price delta in <90 seconds, plus no other interrupting trading or bot activity\nThe second, more profitable stage took advantage of a period of congestion on Osmosis; it remains unclear whether this congestion was organic or engineered for the purposes of the attack.\nWhatever the cause, it allowed for more cases in which the exploiter was free to make their loaded bets as regular user txs couldn’t get through. The report explains:\nA bug in the Osmosis fee market code meant that during times of congestion, the provided gas price was generally insufficient for making trades or performing ongoing bot maintenance activities.\nTo top it off, the project was subject to an ongoing DDoS attack over the majority of the exploit period, hampering their ability to respond.\nThe markets affected and their losses (totaling $1.146M) are as follows:\nstATOM_USD: $241k\nATOM_USD: $229k\nBTC_USD: $190k\nETH_USD: $128k\nTIA_USD: $108k\n*_USDC: $168k + $82k\nThe following step-by-step, provided by Carter L. Woetzel, shows the many factors at play.\n1 Spam txs such that no oracle update txs can get through (from either users or Levana infra)\n2 DDoS backend infra tied to regularly scheduled oracle update txs\n3 Have an intelligent system tracking the delta🔺between the stale data and the actual market pricing that is ready to get pushed\n4 Use a multiexecute tx to go long or short + update the stale data to market pricing - guaranteeing profit for the attacker as they know exactly what the stale price of the oracle is about to get updated to within their multiexecute tx while also comboing it with a long or short guaranteed to be directionally correct.\n5 Because the attacker was the source of congestion, they knew precisely where to submit txs such that they would get accepted by the nodes\n\nLevana had been audited by both FYEO and Peckshield earlier in the year. However, bugs which rely on external factors such as network congestion don't look to have been within scope.\nThe project plans to make users whole via fees and an upcoming airdrop of LVN tokens, and is incorporating a transaction queuing system which will require a fresh oracle price to open positions.\nEven in the autonomous and disembodied world of DeFi, protocols do not exist in a vacuum.\nFundamental considerations such as dependencies on external oracles and the reliance on an underlying network’s fee system must be constantly studied and meticulously tweaked to ensure a stable running product.\nAnd with inscriptions fever spreading across all chains lately, any protocol could find themselves suddenly clogged up.\nCrafty attackers may attempt to identify similar opportunities, waiting for congestion to hit a critical threshold, and ready to strike on multiple fronts.\nBut considering the complexity of this hack, which took advantage of network-level pressures, protocol logic and off-chain systems, all combined with a distracting DDoS attack…\nDid Levana simply get unlucky?\nOr are we seeing the emergence of even more nuanced and time sensitive attacks?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

From there, the exploiter:\nwent on to take various owner-only actions such as allowing any wallet to be able to borrow any available funds from the lending vaults.\nThe attack drained all funds available for borrowing on both Arbitrum and Avalanche, with the only funds protected being deposits in the ‘Depositor vaults’. Steadefi’s TVL fell from over $2M to just $550k.\nAt least some of the remaining TVL appears to have been locked in contracts by the exploiter:\nHowever, the exploiter has also paused the farms contract, which means that if you (and the majority of everyone is) has your svTokens or ibTokens deposited in the farms, you will not be able to withdraw them as well. However, the exploiter is also unable to withdraw them.\nThe funds were swapped to ~625 ETH and bridged to Ethereum before being forwarded onto another address, where they remain.\nAttacker’s address (ETH, ARB, AVAX): 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc\n\nWith many projects having funds returned recently, Steadefi may be hoping for a happy ending.\nHowever, given that this incident was due to an account compromise and not a potential whitehat poking about for bugs in a smart contract, we won’t be holding our breath.\nEspecially if certain state-sponsored phisherman are involved…\nBut who knows, between Arkham’s opening of a public doxx-market and Curve’s bounty hunter reward, we may be seeing the emergence of a new post-hack strategy.\nIn the case of Curve, one bounty hunter (or on-chain bluffer) has already opted to go straight to the source rather than take the 10%:\nHacker.

Notice that the attacker minted 26,000 side tokens into 22,653 Load Token, while in the closeWithDeposit function, there is no such mint function.\nThen we found that the attacker used the side tokens to call the attack contract externally, and used the attack contract to call the mint function.\nBecause in the tokenPrice function, it relies on the number of side tokens to calculate the Load token price, and the total number of tokens has not been updated at this time, resulting in the attacker getting more Load tokens.\nFinally, the attacker calls the burn function to burn 22,653 Load Token to get 27,086 side token.\nThen the attacker calls the related function in a loop to get the side token, and finally converts them to RBTC.\nThe stolen funds were deposited into Tornado cash.\nAn update posted on October 7th assures that no Sovryn individuals need to worry, stating that:\nRoughly half of the funds have been recovered so far\nPotential remaining user losses will be fully covered by the Exchequer\nAnd five days after the attack, a final announcement:\n”All user funds stuck on the ETH bridge have been unstuck. There is only once [sic] exception: the user bridging in USDT to XUSD.”\n\nThere is no shortage of BTC-focused projects on Ethereum, including bridged assets such as WBTC/renBTC and protocols like Badger, but the scale of Bitcoin adoption remains low.\nEven the largest of these, WBTC, with a TVL of ~$5B, barely scratches the surface of Bitcoin’s $387 billion market cap.\nBTC maxis don’t trust their coins to be wrapped onto other networks. Many are suspicious of Ethereum, DeFi and any experimentation regarding what they believe to be a pure cryptocurrency.\nThis incident will only give the bitcoiners even more reasons to cling onto their digital gold.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

They provided the following statement via DM:\nThe vulnerability was included in an upgrade done on April 18 (bscscan.com/tx/0xe0a8e635f…) that upgraded the proxy of LevelReferralControllerV2 (bscscan.com/address/0x9770…) to the vulnerable implementation (bscscan.com/address/0x9f00…).\nThis code is different to the commit audited by Quantstamp as stated in the audit report (certificate.quantstamp.com/full/level-fin…). The source code for the vulnerable implementation in question is not committed in the official public repository of Level Finance in GitHub (github.com/level-fi/level…).\nIn total, 214k LVL tokens were drained by the exploiter, who swapped them for 3,345 BNB, worth approximately $1.1M at the time of writing. The funds currently remain in the attacker’s address.\nThe sell-off of tokens caused the LVL price to drop from $8.42 to a low of $2.93 (-65%), though this recovered substantially following the attack.\n\nAs mentioned by BlockSec, the week that passed between the hacker’s first attempts and their eventual successful exploit demonstrates the potential of on-chain monitoring systems.\nWhen malicious contracts are created containing code designed to interact with DeFi protocols in unconventional ways, tools like Forta, Sentinel and Spotter are able to recognise the actions as suspicious, and alert teams accordingly.\nHowever, few incidents have so much warning.\nDeFi protocols can go from SAFU to rekt from one block to the next.\nUsually, though, an attack contract must be deployed before a hack can be executed. And even a few minutes' warning could be useful for more centralised protocols with the ability to pause contracts.\nIf not, though, BlockSec’s own whitehat frontrunning system has intervened in a number of cases, saving funds and thwarting the efforts of hackers.\nPerhaps a future of on-chain sentinels protecting fully decentralised and self-executing code seems a long way off for now…\n…but who knows what the future will bring?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Given that nothing immediately came of it, it was dismissed as a failed attempt.\nWas it a decoy, perhaps?\nOr a preparatory move?\nExploiter address 1: 0x092123663804f8801b9b086b03b98d706f77bd59\nExploiter address 2: 0x592340957ebc9e4afb0e9af221d06fdddf789de9\nThe successful attack was smuggled in under cover of a proposal to penalise certain ‘cheating’ relayers. While the code purportedly used the same logic as a previous proposal, the attacker had added an extra function which allowed them to selfDestruct the contract.\nThe proposal contract itself was published via a deployer contract. By combining CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes, the attacker could take advantage of their deterministic deployment to deploy new code into the address approved by governance.\n\nUsing selfDestruct, the hacker was then able to erase the approved code, simultaneously resetting their nonce, and allowing for a redeployment of the malicious contract at the same address.\nBlockSec’s Yajin Zhou explains:\nOption I: Use CREATE2 opcode to create a malicious proposal contract. This will raise a flag since CREATE2 and self-destruct are used together.\nOption II: Use CREATE2 to create the deployer contract (0x7dc8), which further deploys the malicious proposal contract (0xc503) using CREATE.\nThen the deployer contract is self-destructed (to reset the nonce), and it can create a new proposal at the same address (0xc503).\n4/ That's because the address of the deployed contract using CREATE depends on the sender and nonce (nonce = 1), enabling the attacker to create a new proposal with the same address (0xc503)\nThese techniques for creating ‘metamorphic contracts’ are one reason that some have called for the selfDestruct opcode to be deprecated.\nThe malicious proposal then assigned 10,000 TORN to all addresses created in last week’s (presumed) failed exploit. These were unlocked and withdrawn from the vault, granting the exploiter 1.2M votes (against 700k legitimate votes) and full control of Tornado governance.\nSee BlockSec’s chart for a full breakdown of the attack stages:\n\n\nIn unexpected turn of events, the exploiter later published a proposal to revert the effects of their hostile takeover, handing back control to the DAO as before.\nApart from the 430 ETH (~$750k) profit from dumping TORN (any guesses where the attacker chose to launder the profits?), the hacker may have other motivations:\nEither they're giga trolling or it will end up being an expensive but not disastrous lesson in Governance security.\nAs community member Tornadosaurus-Hex pointed out:\nI mean note that we don’t even have a choice in regards to this proposal but it is still important nonetheless.\nHopefully, this devastating (albeit impressively crafted) exploit will have a happy ending.\nShould it have been spotted? Maybe.\nBut with recent trouble amongst contributors, perhaps the DAO was not at full strength.\nThe warning “You will be at the helm of negligent tokenholders.” reads as stunningly prescient, in hindsight.\nHowever we got here, hopefully this all turns out to have been nothing more than a storm in a teacup.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The read-only reentrancy vulnerability is a known weakness of this type of LP token, and had previously led to a $220k loss on market.xyz in October.\nAll that glitters is not gold…\n\nCredit: BlockSec, Beosin\nMidas recently added WMATIC-stMATIC Curve LP token for use as collateral. These tokens have a read-only reentrancy vulnerability which allows the token's virtual price to be manipulated when improperly implemented.\nAccording to BlockSec’s analysis the attack has 5 basic steps:\n\nthe calculation of a position's collateral depends on self.D and totalSupply\nself.D is updated after an unexcepted callback, so the four borrows in step 5 to use an outdated self.D.\nthe contract burns stMATIC-f before the unexcepted callback, which causes the four borrows in step 5 to use an updated stMATIC-f.totalSupply().\nAs a result, @MidasCapitalxyz over-estimated the attack contract's position and lent excessive assets to the contract.\nAttacker address: 0x1863b74778cf5e1c9c482a1cdc2351362bd08611\nAttack tx: 0x00534902…\nAttacked smart contract: 0x5bca7ddf1bcccb2ee8e46c56bfc9d3cdc77262bc\nThe attacker was able to borrow the following assets against the inflated collateral:\njCHF: 273,973\njEUR: 368,058\njGBP: 45,250\nagEUR: 45,435\nWhich were then swapped to ~660k MATIC ($660k) and sent on to Kucoin and Binance.\n\nIt’s always a shame to report on losses in DeFi, but especially when they are down to already known issues, with simple workarounds.\nJarvis Network will cover the (~$350k) shortfall in backing of jFIATs that resulted from the exploit, and Midas Capital have reached out to the hacker in an attempt to negotiate a bounty.\nIn a statement to rekt.news, Jarvis Network's founder Pascal Tallarida explained how they plan to deal with the incident going forward:\nAs a result of the Midas exploit, the protocol lost 257k jEUR, 237k jCHF and 45k jGBP, and users lost 111k jEUR and 36k jCHF. The jFIATs belonging to the protocol were not collateralized.\nWe have decided to do not wait after Midas, and we are working on a plan to re-collateralize the jFIATs the protocol lost, and reimburse the users who were victim of the exploit. We will propose to the Jarvis governance to allocate part of the protocol’s revenus (liquidity provision, lending interests, protocol fee and farming with POL) and part of the protocol treasury to it, and we will ask for the help and support of our community, partners, investors, and “frens”. I have already discussed with many of them and they have expressed their will to support us in this difficult moment, either with or without counterparty. Also, the company which is the main liquidity provider within the protocol, will help, with both its treasury and revenues (±$700k last year with swap fees, interests and market making).\nThen, Midas promised us that they will do right by us, by reimbursing what they can, and by helping us to provide value to the protocol. It could take them a while to do so, but I trust that they will do it.\nThis isn’t the first time we have seen a hastily incorporated collateral type leading to a loss, and is unlikely to be the last.\nLet’s hope this rushed decision doesn’t prove to be Midas’ undoing this time…\n\"His senses are captured by the bait, and, thrilled beyond measure, he feasts his greedy eyes on the sight. So Midas, king of Lydia, swelled at first with pride when he found he could transform everything he touched to gold: but when he beheld his food grow rigid and his drink harden into golden ice then he understood that this gift was a bane and in his loathing for gold cursed his prayer.\"\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

Hopefully refunds for today’s victims will be easily budgeted for after the volume they created.\nBut it seems bizarre that Unibot, a team working on a such a similar product, wouldn’t have double-checked their new router code for the same vulnerability after such recent incident.\nIn contrast, some responses from the Unibot team seemed to diminish the risk, potentially leading to further losses.\nOuch.\nTG trading bots, like the recent SocialFi ponzi boom, sacrifice security for convenience.\nWhile this incident did not involve compromised keys, trusting your wallet to a closed-source project is exactly the kind of behaviour we’re continually warned about.\nAnd as today’s incident (as well as LastPass, and StarsArena) shows, these UX tradeoffs sometimes result in costly lessons about trust.\nWill we ever learn?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

After an initial panic, the larger SaucerSwap stated that their users had not been affected. The Hashport bridge was deactivated in response to the attack.\nThe lack of certainty caused chaos, and what turned out to be around $515k stolen by the attacker, turned into $12M of damage to the ecosystem.\nLater, Hedera announced it would be “turning off network proxies on mainnet, making it inaccessible” to users. At the time of writing, Hedera remains down while investigations continue.\nWhen will users get some clarity?\n\nDetails remain scant on exactly how the exploit worked, however, it is clear that the issue was in the network’s Smart Contract Service code.\nIn a Twitter thread, Hedera explained that “The attacker targeted accounts used as liquidity pools on multiple DEXs that use Uniswap v2-derived contract code ported over to use the Hedera Token Service”. HTS was audited by FP Complete in 2021.\nThe head of Pangolin published a preliminary writeup which states the teams believed that the exploit was “only affecting Hashport tokens. This proved to be false. Further investigation revealed all hts [Hedera Token Service] tokens were at risk”.\nThis allowed the attacker to burn bridged/wrapped tokens, as well as remove LP positions from the affected DEXs. According to the report, some funds were bridged back to ETH, after the Hashport team deactivated the bridge, the attacker turned to CEXs.\nAttacker’s address: https://hashscan.io/mainnet/account/0.0.2015717?p2=1\nThe report puts losses from Pangolin at $120k. HeliSwap lost just $2K, according to their rundown of events.\nThe attacker’s alleged addresses contain a total of around $515k; ~$60k of HBAR and $280k of HTS stablecoins on Hedera, and $175k of ETH on Ethereum.\nDespite the news, the network’s native token, HBAR, lost less than the rest of the (currently tanking) market.\n\nIn an industry known for its frequency of multimillion dollar hacks, striking a balance between a clear warning and sowing panic is tricky.\nEspecially following the MyAlgo wallet-draining fiasco last week, the realisation that this incident was not contained to any one protocol was bound to cause chaos.\nWhile the pausing of the chain may have saved some user funds, it’s a worrying move which damages claims of legitimacy as a DeFi platform.\nOne look at Hedera’s “decentralized and transparent governing body” gives an idea of the kind of organisations involved. The likes of Boeing, Dell and Ubisoft don’t strike us as hardcore DeFi idealogues.\nWe may see some clarity over the next few days as to the exact mechanism of the exploit, but the damage has likely been done.\nDeFi users spook easily…\n…and with good reason.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

another reentrancy exploit making its rounds through DeFi.\nAccording to the breakdown provided by Nick Franklin, the attacker's recipe was depressingly simple: find the unguarded _burn function, abuse its burnHook callback, and watch the ETH flow.\nUsing their own malicious token contract and a custom strategy, they orchestrated a dance of incomplete state updates and multiple withdrawals, waltzing away with 133 ETH.\nAttack transaction: 0x8fcdfcded45100437ff94801090355f2f689941dca75de9a702e01670f361c04\nAttacker Address:\n0x012Fc6377F1c5CCF6e29967Bce52e3629AaA6025  \nThe stolen funds didn't stay still for long.\nPeckShield tracked the attacker's movements as they bridged the 133 ETH from Base to Ethereum mainnet, splitting the spoils between two addresses.\nStolen funds sent to:\n0x711C87A0767101Fa6f3893FACb670B5689621e23\n0x7760d838192f6E526721a0f6b160627baE989a3e\nAs fingers pointed and questions flew, attention turned to the protocol's security history.\nThe aftermath revealed a complex web of audit histories.\nTrust Security, who had audited the original contract, were quick to distance themselves from the carnage:\n“A post-audit code change introducing the reentrancy attack was audited by another firm.”\nTrust Security Audit\nMeanwhile, the other firm, Kupia Security found themselves caught in the crossfire after revealing they'd flagged potential issues with malicious strategies – though Clober insisted this was \"NOT related to the reentrancy attack.\"\nAdding another layer to the story, Kupia Security had completed their own audit just days before the exploit.\nThey had raised concerns about potential issues with malicious strategies in the Rebalancer contract, though Clober maintained these warnings were unrelated to the actual exploit.\nKupia Security Audit  \nAccording to Raz0r from Decurity, the vulnerable burnHook call appeared to be a post-audit addition - a critical detail that might explain how such a well-known vulnerability slipped through the cracks.\nA familiar pattern emerged: different audit findings, post-audit changes, and somewhere in between, basic security practices slipped through the cracks.\nIn the end, Clober did what every recently exploited protocol does - offered the attacker a 20% bounty and promised not to press charges.\nBut when protocols treat audits like checkboxes and deploy code without review, who's really to blame when the callbacks come home to roost?\n\nCall them audits, reviews, or security checks - they mean nothing without proper deployment practices.\nProjects rush to tout their security partnerships while quietly pushing unreviewed changes.\nEach reentrancy exploit feels like a rerun, yet protocols keep falling for the same tricks.\nTrust Security and Kupia did their jobs, flagging issues and reviewing code.\nYet somewhere between their reports and deployment, basic security measures vanished into thin air.\nThe carnage that followed serves as another testament to crypto's goldfish memory when it comes to security.\nMaybe next time a protocol considers deploying unchecked code, they'll remember Clober's $500k lesson.\nBut with DeFi's track record, why wait for the next victim when we could just check the callbacks?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The Idols NFT protocol learned a similar lesson about self-reflection.\nDigital mirrors proved just as dangerous as mythological pools when an attacker exploited The Idols' reward system through a simple yet effective manipulation.\nBy making transactions talk to themselves, they drained 97 stETH ($324k) from the protocol.\nThe vulnerability lurked in plain sight – transactions where sender and receiver were identical created an echo chamber of infinite rewards.\nLike the nymph Echo calling out to Narcissus, each mirrored transaction multiplied the damage.\nThe Idols team spotted the exploit within two hours, but the ripples had already spread through their stETH reserves.\nIn the end, perhaps it's fitting that a project called \"The Idols\" fell prey to self-reflection.\nWhen smart contracts fall in love with their own reflection, who's left to tend the pool?\n\nCredit: Tikkala Security, TheIdolsNFT, TenArmorAlert\nTikkala Security first glimpsed the reflection of trouble in The Idols' pool around noon on January 14th, spotting an alarming ripple in the IdolMain contract.\nThe protocol's reward system had become entranced by its own image.\nA critical flaw in the _beforeTokenTransfer() function turned the contract into a hall of mirrors, where each self-referential transaction created infinite reflections of unearned rewards.\n\nThe exploit's vanity was matched only by its elegance: when a transaction gazed upon itself - sender and receiver address perfectly mirrored - and the balance stood at precisely 1, the reward system would fall into a narcissistic loop.\nLike Narcissus himself, the contract became trapped in an endless cycle of self-admiration, doling out stETH rewards it should have kept locked away.\nThe attacker, emerging from the depths of Union Chain, understood this fatal attraction.\nInitial Funding:\n0x26aba26511874128b2bf075c4d5f801b27a42082c1ce7aa25327f61fa0185981\nThrough a series of self-reflecting transactions, they coaxed the protocol into an expensive form of self-worship.\nOne ripple in the pool remains as a reflection of the attacker's artistry.\nExample Attack Transaction:\n0x5e989304b1fb61ea0652db4d0f9476b8882f27191c1f1d2841f8977cb8c5284c\nThe Idols team spotted their distorted reflection in the pool within two hours, warning users away from the treacherous waters.\nBy the time the waters settled, the attacker had drained approximately 97 stETH from the protocol - a $324k reflection of The Idols' vulnerabilities.\nThe exploit's success hinged on manipulating the claim reward logic.\nAccording to TenArmorAlert's analysis, the _beforeTokenTransfer() function suffered from a critical oversight - when processing transactions where the sender mirrored the receiver, and the sender's balance was exactly 1, the system would first delete the claimedSnapshots for the sender before claiming the reward for the same address.\nThis sequence created a fatal vulnerability: instead of verifying previous claims before issuing new rewards, the function would erase its memory of past distributions.\nLike Narcissus forgetting everything but his reflection, the contract would reset its reward tracking state before processing each new claim.\nThe system essentially developed amnesia about what rewards it had already given out.\nThis fatal flaw created a loop of infinite reflections - each time the system gazed at itself, it forgot what rewards had already been claimed.\nThe attacker simply had to repeat this process, watching their stETH balance multiply with each mirror image transaction.\nThe attack unfolded through multiple transactions, each one a perfect reflection of the last.\nThe hacker executed their strategy with the precision of someone who understood exactly what they were looking at.\nBlockchain explorers watched the attacker's address create ripple after ripple across the protocol's surface.\nAttacker Address:\n0xe546480138d50bb841b204691c39cc514858d101\nEven their OpenSea profile stands as a looking glass into their activities:\nOpenSea Account\nFlow of funds can be found here:\nMetasleuth Flow of Funds\nThe Idols had positioned itself as more than just another NFT collection.\nTheir 10,000 generative portraits came with the promise of perpetual stETH rewards - each NFT holder entitled to an equal share of the protocol's growing treasury.\nThe treasury was designed to be \"monotonically increasing\" - a fancy way of saying the stETH principal could never be withdrawn, only the staking rewards earned.\nThis mechanism was meant to ensure NFT holders would always have intrinsic value through their proportional claim on future rewards.\nBut like Narcissus's pool, what seemed beautiful on the surface concealed dangers in its depths.\nThe same reward mechanism meant to provide perpetual value became the vector for its undoing.\nThe protocol's gaze, fixed too long on its own reflection, failed to spot the fundamental flaw in its reward distribution logic.\nWhile previous audits by both CertiK and WhiteHat DAO had examined the protocol in early 2022, none of the contract addresses involved in the exploit match those reviewed in the audits.\nWhatever reflection of security those early reviews provided had long since rippled away.\nThe damage - 97 stETH drained from a protocol designed never to lose its principal - reveals how even the most elegant reward mechanisms can drown in their own reflection.\nWhen smart contracts spend too much time admiring themselves in the mirror, do they forget to check what's lurking beneath the surface?\n\nThe Idols' security reviews from 2022 might as well be ancient Greek scrolls - their wisdom lost somewhere between audit and deployment.\nOver two years passed, code changed, and different contracts emerged bearing only shadows of what CertiK and WhiteHat DAO once examined.\nThe protocol's story reads like mythology now: blessed with dual audits at birth, yet cursed to fall prey to its own reflection.\nTheir reward mechanism, designed to provide eternal value, instead delivered eternal lessons about the dangers of self-reference.\nThose ancient auditors warned of centralization risks and privilege problems, but nobody could have predicted a protocol's narcissistic tendencies would be its undoing.\nNow 97 stETH sleeps beneath the surface of some hacker's pool.\nIn the end, which reflection proves more dangerous - the one we see in the water, or the one we choose to ignore?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

However, this was a heavily funded and promoted project that offered nothing new to the community.\nRaise $4.2m, copy the code from Curve, and get rekt.\nIf you fully understand the maths behind Curve Finance, you have the power to build tools that push forward the technological progress of the human race. So why imitate?\nIf you don’t fully understand the maths behind Curve Finance, why imitate?\nIf you have enough funding to become a VC firm, you have enough cash to invest in projects that offer something new to the world. So why fund a fork?\nAny investor that backed this project values profit over progress.\nThis includes new (and old) media companies, who took money from Saddle in exchange for promotional pieces. We know it’s hard to start a business and you have to take the work when it’s offered, but please consider your reputation...\n\nSaddle finance devops fan, Sunil Srivatsa, was not available for comment.\nThe only unexplored field covered by Saddle Finance was the limitation of IP laws.\nAfter the Saddle Finance pools were arbitraged for millions within hours of launch, the Saddle team were forced to release a formal excuse for their performance, which contained an unacceptable amount of slippage for a protocol designed to “fix the problem of slippage in DeFi”\nSome of the early transactions were executed with high slippage.\nIndividuals may not have yielded to warnings of high slippage.\nIn response to some of those early transactions with high slippage, we’ve updated the front end to make high slippage warnings even more explicit.\nIgor Igamberdiev released several warnings advising users to exit the Saddle Finance pools, while their founder Matt Luongo showed no sympathy for the users who lost money by using the protocol he had helped to copy.\nAt least three major arbs took over 7.9 BTC ($275,735) from the early liquidity providers within 6 minutes.\n4.01 BTC $139,961 Jan-19-2021 04:06:54 PM +UTC\n0.79 BTC $27,573 Jan-19-2021 04:08:46 PM +UTC\n3.11 BTC $108,548 Jan-19-2021 04:12:37 PM +UTC\nUsers who deposited into Saddle Finance in the hour after their launch will never get out as much as they put in, they can only hope that the liquidity rewards are generous...\nYou can’t prevent apes from aping but you can at least care about the outcome.\nMaybe this was all part of Saddle Finance’s marketing plan. If any publicity is good publicity, then maybe they do win, but it’s the early LPs rather than the rich VCs who pay the price for this poor promotion.\nAt least they went to the effort of getting a Quantstamp audit, but then what’s an audit worth if nobody reads them?\nQuantstamp has performed a security review of the Saddle Finance implementation of StableSwap. It is important to note that this implementation is ported from in the Curve Finance contracts, which was used as a reference during the review. In total 14 security issues spanning across all severity levels were identified, along with a few deviations from the specification, code documentation issues and best practice issues. Due to the poor documentation we were not able to determine how the developers have derived some of the implemented formulas from the StableSwap whitepaper. Additionally, we have noticed that all tests in the current test suite use exactly 2 tokens in the pool. We strongly recommend adding more tests that use 3 or more tokens and addressing all identified issues before deploying the code in production.\nThe implemented relation looks different (from the original StableSwap). We are not able to understand how this relation is derived from the relation in the original StableSwap paper, mentioned at the beginning of this description.\nBen Hauser of Curve said:\nThe saddle codebase includes sections of the curve codebase in it's comments to explain how it works. It also says \"check the curve.fi implementation\" at one point when explaining something. They clearly didn’t care much for my gas optimisations, or just lacked the ability to understand why they were optimisations.\nValentin Mihov said:\nIn the open source world, rewriting instead of forking has certain implications. For example, if tomorrow Curve implements something new in their protocol, the rewritten system can’t just merge the changes in. They will need to spend significant time to rewrite them in their system. This is not the case for Sushi or DSD for example. This is where the difference comes imo.\nIvangbi the TG admin provided the following analogy:\n\"I did not copy your book, I translated it to English and added 2 pictures\"\nAbove quotes forked from l0bsterDAO Telegram group.\nConsidering it took Saddle Finance six months to port the Curve code from Vyper to Solidity, the end result leaves much to be desired.\n\nWe await the stale memes of Matt Luongo and team.\n\nThe founders of Saddle Finance are closely linked to the Thesis project - creators of tBTC. veCRV holders expressed their views on the arrival of Saddle Finance by voting to reduce CRV rewards to the tBTC pool.\nSaddle finance devops fan, Sunil Srivatsa, was not available for comment.\n\n“Good artists borrow, great artists steal”\nWhat must have sounded like the perfect quote for the imitators to include in the Saddle Finance smart contract teaches a different lesson when we turn to the original words of T.S Eliot.\nImmature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different than that from which it is torn.\nThe founders and funders of Saddle Finance are all mature enough to know better. There is plenty of opportunity to make money in this industry without copying the work of others.\nThis project will not replace its predecessor, but it does serve to expose the true colours of those who promoted it.\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

These fees are supposedly borne by the user, but during withdrawal transactions these fees were deducted from the rewarder balance instead.\nA deposit/withdraw loop, allowed the hacker to gradually deplete the PLX balance of the pool over the course of 101 transactions, resulting in a massively inflated accSdoPerShare of 1,142,913,215,739,484,400 SDO being rewarded for each PLX deposited.\nWith the rewards system now skewed, the attacker fired a final transaction.\nClaiming the rewards on the initial deposit produced a total of 831,309,277,244,108,000 SDO, which was simultaneously sold, crashing the price of SDO straight to $0.00.\nDespite owning such an enormous quantity of the stablecoin, the attacker could only make off with the defunct coin’s exit liquidity of 202k USDC and 46k USDT.\n\nSo, just $248k, not $248 million.\nAt position number 36 on the leaderboard, hopefully this will be the smallest hack we'll have to cover.\nApparently CTRL C / CTRL V is just as popular when writing about DeFi protocols as it is when forking them.\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.

The team wants to perform some more tests and do some further audits on the bridge.\nThe team’s follow-up statement reassured users that HYPR holders in general were not affected, with losses coming from just two addresses (the only users to have bridged funds up to that point).\nHowever, the token did experience a drop of almost 40% when the proceeds were dumped for 97 ETH, worth approx $220k at the time of writing, the price has since recovered with the market rebound.\nWhile we’ve seen plenty of bridges lose funds to compromised keys over recent months, this is the first example of exploited code leading to a bridge hack since last autumn’s BNB bombshell (unless you count the Shibarium bridge’s temporary self-rekt in August).\nForking code can be risky, especially when devs aren't up to date with issues in the original source.\nShould developers of a codebase designed to be forked take more responsibility for communications?\nOr were Hypr simply not paying enough attention?\n\nCredit: BlockSec, Hypr Network\nThe Hypr Network is built via OP Stack which allows developers to deploy fully functional L2s, forking Optimism as a template.\nIn the Hypr team’s post-mortem thread, they explain that:\nHypr used the most recent version of the develop branch of the OP monorepo at the time of deployment. Unbeknownst to us, this was not a production-ready branch and at the time contained a critical vulnerability which had yet to be patched.\nThe full post-mortem report can be found here.\nBlockSec summarised the vulnerability as follows:\nThe root cause was that the attacker managed to circumvent the 'finalizeERC20Withdrawal' function check by reinitializing the contract, due to the existence of the 'clearLegacySlot' modifier.\n\nExploiter address 1: 0x5b8d598b354f5760b2a65f492154e7a3df46d1be\nExploiter address 2: 0x3ea6ba6d3415e4dfd380516c799aafa94e420519\nAttack tx: 0x51ce3d9c…\nThe exploiter was funded from hacker-favourite FixedFloat and, at the time of writing, the stolen ETH remains in the 0x5b8d address.\n\nComposability, interoperability and building upon open-source code are elements which allow for many of DeFi’s greatest innovations.\nBut they also mean that a bug in one place can affect multiple protocols across the sector.\nCommunication between teams and staying up-to-date with security conversations across the ecosystem is key for anyone relying on forked code. As BlockSec points out:\nNote that the vulnerability was patched by the OP team after the contract had been deployed.\nThis incident underscores the importance of the community working collaboratively to refine the process for releasing security patches, which will undoubtedly benefit us all.\nHypr’s post-mortem report states that, following consultation, with the OP Labs team:\n[OP Labs] agreed that improvements on their release and communications process\nAnd, after reassuring users that other OP infrastructure was unaffected, the Optimism Foundation added:\nWe encourage developers building projects in production to use releases approved by Optimism governance, which meet the security bar established by the Collective. We're also improving our release comms processes to help ensure it's clearer to projects leveraging the OP Stack.\nAs ever, being the first to bridge to a new ecosystem can often lead to lucrative first mover advantages.\nAfter a prolonged period of apathy, FOMO is driving a growing desire to try new things as markets begin to heat back up once again.\nAre the potential rewards worth the risk?\n\nshare this article\nREKT serves as a public platform for anonymous authors, we take no responsibility for the views or content hosted on REKT.\ndonate (ETH / ERC20): 0x3C5c2F4bCeC51a36494682f91Dbc6cA7c63B514C\ndisclaimer: \nREKT is not responsible or liable in any manner for any Content posted on our Website or in connection with our Services, whether posted or caused by ANON Author of our Website, or by REKT.
