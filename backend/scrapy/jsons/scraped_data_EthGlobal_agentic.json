This enables developers to utilize production-ready frameworks such as Eliza and Agentkit, or to upload their own custom frameworks for building agents tailored to their specific needs. Once an agent is built, it can be deployed and hosted on Autonome, utilizing the TEE plug-in to ensure verifiability and security throughout its lifecycle.",

        "About": "AgentKit by Coinbase Developer Platform allows anyone to give their AI agents access to a crypto wallet and onchain interactions with a comprehensive set of actions and plug-and-play integrations with top frameworks. Allow your agents to send USDC fee-free, deploy custom smart contracts and tokens, or interact in the wide world of DeFi.\nCDP SDK is a powerful tool for programmatic blockchain access through easy-to-use APIs. It allows builders to create onchain applications without worrying about the intricacies of blockchain development.\nOnramp allows you to easily onboard fiat into crypto using Apple Pay and common payment mechanisms, while Coinbase Commerces lets merchants easily accept crypto.\nUse the MPC Wallet APIs to create programmable, secure, and powerful experiences that abstract wallet interaction away from users, perform complex orchestration tasks, and facilitate onchain AI agent execution.",

It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.\n  \nFlow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer crypto, and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains to ensure scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought.

With our API approach, Gaia is an alternative to OpenAI. Each Gaia node has the ability to be customized with a fine-tuned model supplemented by domain knowledge which eliminates the generic responses many have come to expect. For example, a Gaia node for a financial analyst agent can write SQL code to query SEC 10K filings to respond to user questions.\nSimilar Gaia nodes are organized into Gaia domains, to provide stable services by load balancing across the nodes. Gaia domains have public-facing URLs and promote agent services to their communities.
