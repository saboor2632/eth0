The first one is that Kinto has User-Owned KYC, meaning every user needs to be verified before sending any transaction. The second one is that Kinto has native Account Abstraction, meaning that users are forced to have a smart wallet instead of plain EOAs and users do not have to worry about or pay gas.\nBenefits of Building on Kinto include: \n- Free KYC, KYT and AML. You get all this compliance tooling out of the box.\n- Sybil resistance.\n- Better UI/UX through Account Abstractions.\n- Higher level of security through Hypernative and Ironblocks.\n- Insurance Policy to all Kinto users.\n- Mining rewards for developers based on the usage and TVL of their applications.\nLearn more in our Docs and Development Guide.",

The network was designed from the ground up to enable consumer crypto applications that scale to mainstream audiences and seamlessly connect to digital ecosystems. It is based on a unique, multi-role architecture, and designed to scale without sharding, allowing for massive improvements in speed and throughput while preserving a developer-friendly, ACID-compliant environment.\n \nFlow has been architected with a clear vision for the future of consumer crypto, and meticulously designed to address the shortcomings of earlier blockchains to ensure scalability, usability, and efficiency are not simply an afterthought. By incorporating critical protocol-level primitives, such as account abstraction and on-chain randomness, as well a powerful transaction model and scalability without sharding, Flow sets itself apart as a blockchain made for those interested in building apps for widespread adoption and developer-friendly innovation.

        "About": "CoW DAO is on a mission to make DeFi safe and seamless for all. It does this by developing user-protective products like CoW Swap (the most-traded DEX frontend, by volume ‚Äì recently surpassing both Uniswap and 1inch), CoW Protocol (the #1 intents-based exchange protocol, with the most robust solver competition in DeFi), MEV Blocker (the leading MEV-protecting RPC endpoint), and CoW AMM (the first MEV-capturing AMM). \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoW Protocol works by separating trade intents from trade executions ‚Äì giving users the ability to express any DeFi-related intent imaginable, while delegating trade execution to sophisticated matching engines called solvers. Ultimately, this results in better prices for users, while protecting them from bad outcomes like MEV exploitation. In addition to hosting the largest solver competition in DeFi, CoW Protocol has the most-advanced developer framework of any DEX. Programmatic Orders let developers deploy orders that execute perpetually into the future based on arbitrary conditional logic, and CoW Hooks let developers chain swaps together with any other DeFi action (ie: simplifying advanced DeFi actions). The sky is the limit! \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCoW AMM is the first MEV-capturing AMM. Only CoW Protocol solvers are allowed to trade against CoW AMMs, meaning that ‚Äì since solvers win auctions by offering users more surplus ‚Äì CoW AMM pools grow by capturing value for LPs that would normally go to arbitrage bots. Because liquidity pools auto-rebalance and protect LPs from LVR, they behave like enhanced index funds that (according to portfolio theory) reduce risk and increase return for tokenholders. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubmissions will be judged on creativity and utility. We will only accept working prototypes.",

Dstack provides developers the freedom to build beyond the limits of today's Web3 development. With the Dstack SDK, devs can make remote attestations and key derivations in the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) from their own docker apps written in ANY language they prefer to build in. All developers need to do is build a docker image of the project, and the project is ready to be deployed on a TEE Server. For local development, we offer a docker TEE Simulator so you can test your products locally before launching in a real TEE Server.\n_\n‚ÅâÔ∏è WTF is TEE ‚ÅâÔ∏è\nTEE (Trusted Execution Environment) is a cool CPU feature that makes your code Verifiable and Privacy-Preserving by locking it in a black box. Trusted hardware ensures even the OS or hardware can't mess with your code. For example, when you put a Web2 app in a TEE, you get Web3 out!\n_\n‚ùìHow is it Verifiable‚ùì\nThe verifiable hardware produces Remote Attestation, which proves the exact code is running in a genuine TEE with integrity and privacy guarantees.\nGet the RA quote from your app and verify it on the TEE Attestation Explorer at https://dstack-sim-explorer.vercel.app\n_\nüåüüåüüåü\nBonus Bounty - Ledger Nano X for top prize or top 10 finish! üöÄ\nüåüüåüüåü",

This algorithm is leaderless and provides strong security through asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT). The network is governed and operated by a diverse and decentralized council of top enterprises, universities, and web3 projects globally, ensuring responsible and transparent governance.Hedera's optimized EVM smart contracts enable developers to easily build applications using familiar EVM-based tools and infrastructure, and facilitate smooth deployment or migration across multiple chains. In addition, Hedera offers native services for tokenization and consensus. The Hedera Token Service (HTS) enables developers to create and manage native digital assets that interact with the EVM. These tools empower developers to build robust, real-time web3 applications and ecosystems, making the vision of a more connected and efficient internet a reachable goal.Hedera provides deterministic finality within 3 seconds, low fixed and predictable transaction fees, and fair transaction ordering with consensus timestamps. Its robust and scalable infrastructure makes it a reliable choice for developers.",
